Financial institutions (FIs) are willing to relax some of the covenants for term loans to infrastructure projects funded on recourse/non-recourse basis to improve loan offtake.,"Financial institutions (FIs) are willing to relax some of the covenants for term loans to infrastructure projects funded on recourse/non-recourse basis to improve loan offtake. The relaxations will depend on merits of individual cases.
 
 Officials said lock-in provisions could be one of the covenants expected to be relaxed. Currently, there is a lock-in for 51 per cent of the promoter's equity during debt repayment period.
 
 However, recent concession agreements for projects promoted by the Central and state governments, port trusts, municipal bodies and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), provide for dilution of between 26 and 33 per cent once projects enter into the operation and maintenance phase. These agreements insist on a 51 per cent equity lock-in only during the construction phase.
 
 Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation is probably the first to have offered the relaxation.
 
 Almost all the FIs are currently experiencing poor offtake of loans in view of some of the conditions insisted upon by them. These conditions include, physical asset cover to the extent of 150 per cent of the loan value, revenue escrow account, equity lock-in for promoters and corporate/debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) guarantees.
 
 These conditionalities have been turning promoters away from the FIs. Increasingly, promoters have been opting for securitised debt offerings. Such offerings are made in the form of debentures through private or public placements, with revolving letter of credit-backed guarantees from foreign banks. This allows subscription from provident funds and insurance companies.
 
 NHAI, a government agency, is one of the entities seeking relaxation in the lock-in criteria as financiers already had the first charge on revenue escrow accounts, obviating the need for a lock-in for promoters. Besides, some of the projects are to be promoted directly by NHAI through equity participation in special purpose vehicles and subsequently carrying out a phased divestment to raise resources for further investments.
 
 State Bank of India, which is financing the Moradabad bypass project, is not insisting on any lock-in for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the promoter. 
 
 Insisting on lock-in would also inhibit the ability of promoters from refinancing and foreclosing project debt through issuance of instruments like fully convertible debentures and convertible preference shares.
 
 Foreign banks, which are prepared to either extend external commercial borrowings or provide long-term rupee loans or guarantees, do not insist on such lock-ins if projects conform to minimum DSCR requirements. 
 
 DSCR indicates the ability of a project to pay back debt. The minimum stipulated DSCR requirement
 currently stands at 1.5 times of the operating cash flows.
 
 Officials said instead of such lock-in, what was being insisted on part of the covenants is in the form of minimum DSCR requirements during the debt repayment period. 
 
 This is in the form of subordinated loans from the promoters themselves in the event of a shortfall in project revenues. Such arrangements were being facilitated to allow promoters to exit and allow for prepayment of  project debt.

 After 23 years, a US president has finally agreed to visit India -- and even he is coming only at the very end of his two terms in office.","
 After 23 years, a US president has finally agreed to visit India -- and even he is coming only at the very end of his two terms in office. These two facts can be interpreted in two ways. One is that India doesn't count for much in US calculations; the other is that it is now beginning to count, otherwise why would the American president bother? As for India, it has now finally understood that if you live in the river, you don't quarrel with the alligator. More than anything else, India's US policy is now driven by this realisation. Whether it likes it or not, it has to accommodate US interests. In return, it can hope for some reciprocation. If Indian demands fit in with overall US interests, the US will cooperate. If not, there's nothing that India can do about it.
 
 The US has always had two important foreign policy objectives. One is the prevention of nuclear proliferation so that it remains in control and its own security is not endangered. The other is enhanced market access. Under this overall rubric, there has also been a regional agenda for different regions. During the Cold War this sub-agenda was to ensure a diminution in Soviet influence; now it is to ensure that there are no regional wars. This it is doing by ""promoting"" democracy on the grounds that democracies are less likely to go to war with each other.
 
 Mr Clinton's visit has to be seen in this overall context and, if one makes a checklist, it turns out that non-proliferation and the prevention of a regional war remain fairly intractable. Mr Clinton had made the indefinite extension of the NPT and the signing of the CTBT the cornerstones of his non-proliferation agenda. India has refused to sign both but has conveyed enough signals to convince the US that it will, in the fullness of time, sign the CTBT. 
 
 That leaves just one major worry for the US: the possibility of a regional war in Kashmir. Before India and Pakistan conducted their nuclear tests, there was no real threat of a nuclear war. But now that their weapons are out in the open, one or the other may be pressured into doing the unthinkable. Kashmir will, therefore, form an important part of the agenda. The US will want to know how India intends to deal with the situation. The chances are that India will bleat on about Pakistan. But this is not enough, since it has only succeeded in convincing the world about Pakistan's role in Kashmir but not, however, about its own role there. 
 
 That is why it needs to move forward by presenting a concrete and actionable domestic agenda for the troubled valley. Sadly, such an agenda is not anywhere in sight. Worse, no one is even thinking about one, remaining content instead with the unsustainable status quo. Indeed, from India's point of view, the US should continue to deal with Pakistan -- a Clinton stopover included. Given the way bilateral ties have deteriorated rapidly, some degree of American pressure on Pakistan, applied directly, will encourage that benighted country to exercise some restraint.
 
 Other than that, little should be expected from the visit, as the US secretary of state has said quite bluntly, other than to signal in the broadest possible terms that India and the US are expressing an intent to work closer together

 The attempt to revise the takeover code in order to make it more effective has run into predictable problems because of the compromises that have been made over it in the past.","
 The attempt to revise the takeover code in order to make it more effective has run into predictable problems because of the compromises that have been made over it in the past. There is a basic clash between the interests of those who control businesses with fairly small levels of shareholding, and a code which seeks to protect small shareholders.
 
 If the code were to deliver its basic objective, it would become increasingly difficult for anyone to control a business with a small stake. As many of those currently controlling businesses do not have the resources to make public offers in order to hike their stake and improve their sense of security, the takeover code has been diluted to allow them to wriggle out of making public offers.
 
 One way of doing this has been to waive the need to make an open offer under the code in situations where there is a change of control, if 51 per cent of the shareholders agree to the change through an ordinary resolution. This is obviously not a happy situation for anyone interested in an effective code and so the proposal has come up, during the revision exercise, for the exemption to be allowed only if the resolution is passed by 75 per cent of shareholders. But this, it seems, has opened up a can of worms and may eventually lead Sebi into a degree of micro-management which can be in nobody's interest. For example, if the 75 per cent rule were to be introduced, it would be possible to change a director or directors with an ordinary resolution but a change in directors as a result of a change in control would require a special resolution. If the logic is stretched to its absurd limit it might require a public offer merely to change a managing director. 
 
 The review exercise is barking up the wrong tree. Instead of tightening exemptions, they should be removed altogether. The way to avoid such absurdities is to go back to the basics. The takeover code is meant to govern 'substantial acquisition of shares' and should concentrate on it. It is and should continue to come into play through the operation of certain trigger points. The conditions under which there would be an obligation to make a public offer should be made more stringent with time. Right now a very high annual creeping acquisition limit of 5 per cent is allowed, which negates the code but has been incorporated so as to enable those controlling businesses with low stakes to hike them cheaply. Similarly, there is no compulsion to make an unconditional offer -- that is, buy off anybody who comes forward -- once an offerer's holding goes beyond 50 per cent. This keeps out in the cold minority shareholders who miss the ambit of limited offers. There should be a sunset clause to such provisions.

 The budget can make fundamental improvements, says  Sukumar Mukhopadhyay
 
 The Government having committed itself to the idea of introducing VAT from April 2001, must do a few things in this budget about changing the fundamental structure of the existing system of Modvat so that it can be a part of the overall system of VAT model. I have written earlier in the columns of this paper that Modvat could better be abolished. What I am now writing is that if Modvat has to continue at all, it must be improved fundamentally so that the 'Mod' (modified) can be dropped from Modvat and it can be VAT.
 
 That brings us to the question of how Modvat is different from a full-fledged VAT. The crucial difference is that while VAT is a tax on value added under any circumstances, Modvat is a tax on value added only if manufacture takes place. So manufacture is the essence of Modvat. Apart from this basic difference, there are other concomitant features which arose due to the system having started piece meal in 1986 and culminating in 1999. So the year 2000 will be a good time to give it an extra push to make it Y2K compliant.
 
 The system of Modvat as it is now has degenerated into one where allowing credit for the input paid is done only on a case to case basis. For each input such as humidifier used in the textile mills for keeping the texture soft; glass bottles for filling in them soft drinks; alternator for generating set; static converter panel for speed control and innumerable other items, the issues have travelled to the tribunal. Any man of common prudence can judge them as needed for manufacture but they become the subject matter for decision by the commissioner and the tribunal. 
 
 So the journey in each case becomes expensive and tedious. This inevitably leads to squaring up issues at the lower level, which is the other name of corruption. This sort of issues regarding admissibility of credit and other technical cum procedural issues constitute 87 per cent of all so-called offence cases detected while substantial cases are 7 per cent and clearly fraudulent cases are 6 per cent. This has been revealed by an empirical study made by the NIPFP on the basis of data for January 1994 to July 1995 (VAT in India ""” a progress report p 39).
 
 The basic conceptual problem in Modvat is the definition of manufacture, which has been subject to varying interpretations over the decades making it one of the most litigated subjects. There is no finality or stability. In the last five years or so the Supreme Court has given such crucial judgments on the subject that the whole concept has undergone change leading to tremendous readjustments in the fiscal structure. 
 
 In one judgment (C.C.E Bombay vs Fine Chemicals 1995 vol. 77 ELT 49 SC) the Supreme Court said that even artificial definitions are permissible which high courts and the Supreme Court have been opposing consistently in the past. In another (Sirpur Paper Mills vs C.C.E.Hyderabad 1998 vol. 97 ELT 3 SC) the Supreme Court has laid down that even complete plants erected at site are marketable goods ignoring other previous judgments of the same court to the contrary. 
 
 Such earthshaking judgments of the concept of manufacture make credit of input duty a highly unsure proposition. To remove all the controversies and to introduce full VAT at the same time we need to allow the input credit for the final product on the basis of ""use in the factory"" rather than for ""use in manufacture"" as now. Machines to check pollution or chemicals to neutralise the effluents to make the factories eco-friendly are not entitled to credit of excise duty paid on them at present. The suggestion above will solve that problem also.
 
 The controversies relating to the concept of input and capital goods leading to interpretation problems about admissibility of credit of duty paid on them cannot be solved by giving clarifications by the board or judgments by the tribunal. This can be done only by declaring that all goods which are used in the factory are subject to credit of duty paid on them except those which are in a list called Negative List. This may include petrol, diesel, computer and air conditioner used in office, etc. This will fundamentally change the structure of Modvat into VAT at one stroke.
 
 Some procedural changes are also needed for this conversion. An important thing to be done is to rewrite the rules regarding Modvat by scrapping the existing maze created over the last 14 years. The distinction between inputs and capital goods is to be abolished which by itself will make them simpler. This will eliminate the mystery created by 57Q. Rules for reversion of credit (57cc) will not be necessary if exemptions in a factory are not allowed and if the factory also makes dutiable goods for which it takes credit. 
 
 There has to be also some restructuring of the tariff in consonance with the need for VAT. Most of the exemptions have to be removed as they destroy the neutrality and bring distortion (Allan Tait-VAT ""” Practice and Problems p 221 and Hemming and Kay in VAT- Lessons from Europe). The tariff has to also have just three rates in place of the five now. Also in the same chapter, the same rate of duty should be there as far as possible. Without a simple and transparent tariff the operation of VAT will not derive the full benefit. 
 
 The conclusion is that Modvat can be converted into a full-fledged VAT only by
 
 changing over from the concept of taxing the value added due to manufacture; 
 
 substituting the concept of manufacture by the concept of use; l making all goods subject to credit by a sweeping move except in the case of goods in the Negative List ;
 
 removing distinction between capital goods and inputs for purposes of input credit; 
 
 having the same Rules for both of them; 
 
 simplifying the excise tariff drastically removing the exemptions which cause distortion and reduce the neutrality of tax; and 
 
 adopting document based audit control in place of counter signature of invoices. 
 
 This budget must do the needful now rather than keep it for the next year.

Elliot Wave Theory is a specialised area of technical analysis.,"Elliot Wave Theory is a specialised area of technical analysis. Vivek Patil uses Neely's modifications to extrapolate the Sensex's moves from here into the long-term future.
 
 In a series of articles published in The Smart Investor starting July 7, 1997, it was predicted by means of Neely-Modified Elliot Wave analysis that the Sensex would achieve a minimum target of 5545 points by January 2000. Since that target has been exceeded by the Large X wave currently in force, another update is in order.
 
 The previous article in this series (The Smart Investor, 26th July 1999) gave long term projections. An updated analysis suggests that the Sensex could have an upside of about 25 per cent (7100 point levels) before this Large-X terminates. Then there will be a powerful retracement pulling it back to 5200 levels. This will be followed by a powerful surge to 45,000 points by 2025.
 
 Let us start with a recap on the Super-Cycle Degree Wave Count which was calculated on the RBI Shares Index. The Super-Cycle degree wave 1 finished in the year 1946.
 
 This was followed by the corrective wave 2 till 1983 (37 years). The wave 3 commenced in April 1983, and the ""Cycle"" degree wave-1 within it finished in September 1994. From September 1994 onwards, we have been in the Cycle degree wave-2, which will complete only after 2002.
 
 A close examination of this Cycle degree Wave 2 is in order. This was projected to be a ""Complex Corrective"" involving two standard correctives separated by a large-X wave. The first corrective was a ""C Failure Flat"" from September 1994 to April 1999. Within this, the wave-b was an ""Expanding Triangle"" and wave-c was a ""Terminal Impulse with 5th Failure"" ending at 3183 points in April 1999.
 
 A re-examination of the cap on the Large -X Wave: By definition, a ""Large-X"" should see a minimum 1.618 times move from the first corrective end, which gave the minimum earlier target of 5545. This has been achieved. Its internal construction would alternate with the first corrective, which was a Flat. Therefore, the current ""Large-X"" should be a ""Zigzag"" or a ""Double Zigzag"".
 
 What's happening now?
 
 Remember that 5545 was the 1.618 ""Minimum"" target for the Large X, and it could go up in Fibonacci ratios to a level of 7100 points, which would be a 2.618 ratio to the first corrective. If such a case occurs, we are currently only in the middle of the Large X wave as shown in the projection in Chart 1. After consolidating at this current level of about 5700, we (5400) might see a further movement beyond 7000 as shown.
 
 Whipsaws
 
 Within the Large X wave, one would normally see whipsaws where some new stocks and sectors would skyrocket while erstwhile pivotals languished. Thus the trading strategy, therefore, is necessarily dictated by the individual stock/sector specific stories.
 
 Warning
 
 All Large X waves usually end with a ""Terminal"" or ""5th failure"" which generates a sharp fall. This fall retraces almost exactly 50 per cent of the entire Large X. In case of the Sensex, assuming X finishes off around 7100, then the fall would be 50 per cent retracement of 3183 to 7100, i.e. around 2000 points. In this fall, there would be all-round value erosion.
 
 Stand warned on this account. Regardless of the exact level at which the Large X terminates, a 50 per cent retracement is likely and calculated by half the move from 3183 to the top.
 
 We see a famous historical examples in chart 3 of the American Dow Jones Industrial Averages. Such falls occurred in the Crash of 1929 as well as in the Crash of 1987. Both came at the end of a Large X within the 2nd wave. It was a Super-cycle degree in 1929 and a Cycle degree in 1987 respectively. Both these falls were 50 per cent of the respective Large X waves.
 
 Back to the Future
 
 After the Large X, the second corrective would occur for next 2-3 years. The sharp fall after Large X will only be the ""a"" leg of the second corrective. The second corrective would possibly be a Triangle and would terminate only after the year 2002. Once the Cycle degree wave-2 is over (sometime after 2002), the Cycle degree 3rd of the Super-Cycle degree 3rd would commence. In this most dynamic phase, the Sensex should definitely cross 45,000 in a surge that peaks before the year 2025.
 
 Importance of the Perspective
 
 Such long-term wave counts and projections are basics for policy-makers and visionaries, who have long-term plans. As Sensex is the indicator of what can be expected in the economic future, the projections could well have an important bearing on their strategies.
 
 Traditional method v/s Neely method
 
 To calculate this wave-count and projection, I have employed the Neely method, which is more involved, and uses a more complex set of rules. Some people may find this difficult to follow but it greatly reduces the chances of errors. Other analysts may use the simple basic rules in the traditional method of Elliott Wave Analysis developed by R.N.Elliott, and later popularised by Robert Prechter.
 
 As Neely says : "" NEoWave (via the Neely method) can be compared to Elliott Wave Analysis in the same way as calculus is different from algebra. Nothing about calculus negates algebra, it is just more complex, allowing for the solving of more complex problems.""
 
 An interesting long-term controversy has developed about the two methods and their application to Wall Street. Employing the traditional method against Neely method, one can make two different wave counts. In the case of the DJIA, Neely was totally bullish over the last 8 years, saying that the Dow should cross 1,00,000 points by the year 2060. 
 
 Whereas, Prechter has been totally bearish during the same period, saying DJIA should actually fall below the 1000 level. Even at the current levels of above 11000 points, Prechter continues to be bearish. He says, ""A major, indeed historic, downturn is developing"". It would be interesting to see who is right.
 
 But what if everyone knows?
 
 Some people have expressed doubts about the efficacy of market action according to projections, when the same projections are common knowledge to all. But the Wave Theory is a Natural Phenomenon. Just as no one can change the laws of Nature, wave projections cannot be changed, although they can become more complex. Neely believes: ""As too 
 
 many people have tried to apply Elliott Wave Theory, the markets have just enhanced the complexity level of patterns to keep most 
 people in the dark. ""

 The Indo-French Initiative Forum will hold a two-day session ending February 15. On February 16 and 17 the India International Centre will host a high-level, closed-door seminar on Strategies to Create a Multipolar World. And the week will be capped by French foreign minister, Hubert Vederine's visit to New Delhi.
 
 None of the events is without political significance. France is looking to wider and deeper defence cooperation with India, particularly to sell the Indian Air Force, the Alpha Jet Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT). By happy coincidence, the Patrouille de France is performing all its aerobatics on the Alpha Jet.
 
 The Indian Air Force says it has nothing to do with the event or its timing _ the rivals of the Alpha Jet, the Hawk, flown by the British aerobatic pilots, the Red Arrows, put up a similar air show (using the Hawk, obviously), in New Delhi last year. Both the Alpha Jet and Hawk used are trainer aircrafts. 
 
 The French are lobbying hard to find buyers for their aircraft _ their order books are blank, they have been so for the last 10 years.
 
 The German Air Force which used the Alpha Jet has discontinued it. If India buys the aircraft, France will have the chance of reviving its production facility as India will require above 60 aircraft.

"During the calendar year 1999, the Indian software industry has achieved a growth of 52 per cent at $5 billion over $3.9 billion during 1998 and is poised to grow at 60 per cent to reach $8 billion during the year 2000.

 Out of the $5 billion earnings, the contribution of export earnings was $3.5 billion while the domestic earnings was $1.5 billion. 
 
 According to Dewang Mehta, president, Nasscom, which made the predictions based on its recently conducted study, ""the 60 per cent projected growth during the year 2000 proves the point that the Indian software industry is not dependent merely on Y2K revenues.""
 
 According to the Nasscom survey, there was a slow down of Y2K orders in the last two quarters in the year 1999. However, the slowdown was more than offset by new opportunities created in growth areas such as e-commerce and IT enabled services, which accounted to almost 16 per cent of the export revenues generated in the second half of 1999.
 
 ""As Indian software companies successfully completed Y2K related projects for more than 104 of the Fortune 500 companies, most of these companies are now getting repeat orders for software projects to India as they have developed confidence and faith in the Indian software industry,"" Mehta said.
 
 E-commerce, application service providers, IT enabled service, legacy to web transformation, communications software and system on chip are projected to be the prominent emerging sectors for software exports in the years to come.
 
 The domestic software market has also grown from $1 billion in 1998 to $1.5 billion in 1999 and is expected to grow to $2.2 billion in 2000. ""The key segments contributing to the growth in the domestic market will be in the areas of banking, Internet banking, e-governance, healthcare, defense and small office home office,"" he  said.

It has also requested the finance minister to implement the recommendation of the national IT task force and to retain the zero import duty regime on computer software.
 
 Nasscom has also called upon the government to implement the recommendations by the Sebi committee on venture capital, headed by K B Chandrashekhar. 
 
 In another demand it has asked the government to revise the guidelines for taxability on employees stock option scheme (Esop) so that the beneficiary of the scheme are only taxed at the time of sale of stock option and not at the time of exercise. ""The Esop should also make it mandatory that employee can only exercise it after at least one year of date of offer. This will further justify the applicability of long term capital gains,"" pointed out the industry association.
 
 ""This has already been accepted by the national IT task force and ministry of information technology and the current Esop tax guidelines are causing lot of hardship to employee,"" said Mehta. ""Nasscom has worked closely with Sebi in formulation of Esop guidelines so that not only wealth could be distributed amongst the employees, but also to curtail brain drain. However, current taxation guidelines of Esop are not at all favourable,"" he added.
 
 Nasscom has also demanded increase in limit of Indian employee taking Esop in overseas companies from the current limit of $ 10, 000 to at least $ 100, 000 for the period of five years.
 
 Nasscom has also demanded continuation of benefits under section 80HHE of Income Tax Act, which allows income tax exemption to profits from software exports.
 
 ""Any withdrawal of benefits could adversely affect the growth of software exports, "" Mehta said.

"The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has told the 1,050 mw Videocon power project to attain financial closure by April 30 .","The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has told the 1,050 mw Videocon power project to attain financial closure by April 30 . The project is coming up at Ponneri in Chengalput district near Chennai. 
 
 Confirming this, a TNEB official said, ""The power purchase agreement (PPA) had lapsed on February 1. The promoters had requested for an extension, but we have given them time till April 30. We hope the project comes through."" 
 
 However, chairman of Videocon International, the group flagship, V N Dhoot said, ""We have already attained financial closure. We will communicate our decision much before the deadline."" But the TNEB official retorted, ""we are unaware of the project attaining financial closure"". 
 
 TNEB was considering scrapping of  the PPA if the earlier deadline of February 1 was not met. But now, TNEB officials indicate that an extension beyond April 30 may be allowed in the interest of the project. 
 
 The project was originally slated to attain financial closure by April 30, 1999, but was stuck due to various problems. Later, the February 1, 2000 deadline could not be met due to certain disputes over the fuel supply agreement. Besides, lenders were keen on entering into certain agreements, superseding the PPA.
 
 The power project is being implemented as a joint venture between the Videocon group, ABB and National Power of the UK. Videocon is the largest shareholder with 38 per cent stake, while ABB and National Power are committed to bringing in 26 per cent and 36 per cent respectively.
 
 However, ABB is now reconsidering its decision to invest in the project and may eventually pull out although the Zurich-based parent is supposed to take a final decision in this regard.
 
 The ABB stand is that there are certain critical issues related to the returns the project offers to the investing companies that need to be resolved. Even if the company decides against taking an equity stake in the project, it will continue to be the engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the project.

 ","Sebi's announcement that it was considering imposing margins on institutional trades has evoked mixed reactions from the broking community.
 
 ""This is keeping in line with international standards,"" said Ramesh S Damani, Bombay Stock Exchange broker.
 
 However, there were others who felt that that there was no need to bring institutions under the purview of margins as there was little chances of any payment default.
 
 ""If margins are imposed on institutional trades, it would affect volumes as institutions would then try to scale down their level of operations,"" said an institutional broker.
 
 For instance, for a transaction worth Rs 5 crore, the institution would have to pay a margin of at least 25 per cent, considering a modest margin of 5 per cent.
 
 In case of retail customers, where margins involved are relatively lower, brokers invariably do the funding.
 
 ""While this is not exactly legal, the broker knows that if he refuses, the customer will in turn go to some other broker who is willing to fund the margin cost,"" said a veteran BSE broker.

"According to Sean Maloney, senior vice-president and director _ sales and marketing group, Intel Corp, the Internet is throwing up a new breed of companies that will take businesses successfully to the Net.","According to Sean Maloney, senior vice-president and director _ sales and marketing group, Intel Corp, the Internet is throwing up a new breed of companies that will take businesses successfully to the Net. These are, in Intel lingo, e-business solutions providers (eBSPs). Excerpts from a interview with BS.
 
 What are the objectives behind the eBSP programme?
 
 The main purpose is to get the best solutions available on Intel architecture. If you buy an Intel-based machine, its main benefit, versus a proprietary system, is that it is open. The danger of a proprietary machine is that you are locked in for the next 15 years. So, we want to get as many different solutions on the Intel architecture as possible. That is I guess the main reason.
 
 Also, it is absolutely true that we are trying to spread ourselves across the Internet. And you will see us invest in India in a lot of Internet companies, I am sure.
 
 Why launch this now? 
 
 Y2K is out of the way. And a lot of companies are thinking about e-business deployment, and Internet security. These are the two big issues for companies.  The paranoia has moved from Y2K to security. it took about 5 weeks. That is going to be the theme for the next five years.
 
 Aren't PCs going to fade away, ever?
 
 The PC market is much maligned. There are people always saying that the PC is dead. Three years ago, they were saying that the thin client would take people away. The current `PC is dead' hyperbole will fade away in the next few months.
 
 You have to look at what you need in an Internet device. You need a processor, some local storage and a monitor. That is a PC. Some people say you don't need local storage - you can have a stupid terminal connected to a mainframe. That is not possible, communications infrastructure is not reliable enough yet. Anything that wants to replace the PC as an Internet access device still needs these three basic components.
 
 The revolutionary nature of the medium is its interactivity. You have to retain that, nothing does that as well as the PC. Things like the Cellphone are good only for little bits of information. It doesn't convey the richness of the medium.

"Interesting as it may sound, after having touched a new high the Sensex invariably begins to slide within the first 30 minutes of trading.","Interesting as it may sound, after having touched a new high the Sensex invariably begins to slide within the first 30 minutes of trading. Yesterday, too, the BSE-30 Sensex opened almost 196.67 points higher at 6,130.23 at 09.55 am against its previous close of 5,933.56. Then in barely two minutes (09.57 am), it zoomed to a record of 6,150.69. However, within just 28 minutes of trading the benchmark index fell by nearly 74 points to 6,076.69 (by the time domestic and foreign fund managers take a decision to sell the stock). Thereafter, the Sensex gave way and the index continuously dropped every 30 minutes on continuous selling pressure across all major sectoral stocks like cement, pharmaceuticals, FMCG, auto, steel and cement.
 
 Sebi's decision to enforce an additional 5 per cent margin on top ten counters also had a significant impact on the bourses. The Sensex finally closed at 5,924.31 (marginally higher than the intra-day low of 5,923.17 points).
 
 Gaining momentum
 
 Buying interest at the BSES counter is spreading fast as more institutional players are entering the fray. The treasury arm of the US-based bank continues to be a regular buyer at the counter even as he is finding company in other fund managers too. A little over a lakh shares are reported to have been picked up yesterday even the market was rife with rumours that the company was in the process of buying out a portal.
 
 Wrong number
 
 Close to 7 lakh shares are reported to have been dumped at the MTNL counter as the seller party took full advantage of the firm opening of prices. A couple of weeks back, the scrip had run up non stop from Rs 180 to Rs 324 and then fallen back till Rs 255 levels. After consolidation, the scrip once again moved up one way till Rs 390, before giving a correction signal yesterday. Till aggressive buying interest surfaces in the next couple of trading sessions, the supply overhang could restrict a sharp upsurge in prices. Overall outlook on the scrip still remains positive considering that a NYSE listing is in the offing.
 
 Lone ranger
 
 Even in a falling market, the ABB scrip managed to end the day on a strong note, in fact at the upper end of the circuit filter. The Question brokerage (just ASK) is reported to be a steady buyer at the counter. Currently, it is more of retail and high net worth investors, who are buyers at the counter. Not a bad bargain considering that the company is planning an increased software thrust as also the fact that the scrip available close to its 5-year low prices.
 
 For old times sake
 
 One of the surprise gainers in yesterday's weak market was the Videocon scrip. In the past this scrip has not really been a favourite with fund managers. In the last six to eight months, bulls at the counter have been trying their best to give a leg up to the prices. However the scrip has always failed to sustain at higher levels. One possibility could be that players who are still stuck with the shares purchased prior to the payment crisis, are selling at every rise.
 
 Bank on it
 
 The race between HDFC Bank and SBI is not over yet, with both players still running neck and neck. While buying interest at the HDFC counter has subdued of late, fresh buying interest seems to be emerging at the SBI counter. A little over a million shares are reported to have been picked up yesterday by a foreign fund.
 
 Remains to be seen if this buying interest is good enough to generate follow up buying from the smaller players. A couple of weeks back, close to 2 million shares were picked up over a span of 4 days. However, they were not good enough to boost prices.

 After making the monthly cellular rentals cheaper by Rs 80 to Rs 395 as against The rate of Rs 475 finalised by the Delhi High court, the company is unleashing yet another set of customer-friendly schemes.  
 
 Earlier, cellular operators were charging a monthly rental of Rs 600.  The Delhi High Court had asked the cellular operators to reimburse the difference of Rs 125 to its subscribers with retrospective effect from November 1999.  
 
 From tody, while 1.33 lakh Orange subscribers will be reimbursed the differenc in rentals of around Rs 205 (Rs 600 less Rs 395), the committed time in their respective schemes to the next month.  
 
 Further, the unutilised timings can be accumulated for usage for six months.  
 
 At present the unutilised timings are not carried forward to the following month.  
 
 The reimbursement will be in one-time payment rather than making provisions in the monthly bills.  The outgo for the company is expected to be around Rs 2.72 crore.
 
 Explaning the rationale, the company chief operative officer Snadip Das said ""the two new measures are intended to add base value to our customers who will receive a lot of relief from these measures.""
 
 Globally, Orange stands for transparency and honesty, Das said adding that this would be followed in true sprit in India also. He described these measures as the values associated with Orange taking off in India.
 
 On impact on the cellular industry, the measures are expected to increase the customer base in the country to around 10 lakh by 2002-03 from the present 3 lakh. ""We believe in expanding the cellular industry and thereby adding our customer base,"" Das said.
 
 All these measures are expected to remove the barriers to entry into the cellular market.
 
 However he said categorically ""we are not competing on a lower price, but by offering a fair value to our customers"". 
 
 Industry observers said the company is planning to offer more sops to its customers in future to add the customer base.
 
 However Das is silent on the forthcoming value addition offerings, but said there are many more to add to the present list.

 ","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) yesterday pulled up major stock exchanges for not doing much to check manipulative tendencies
 
 Although the regulator expressed satisfaction on collection of margins, it informed the bourses that they needed to be far more proactive on abnormal price movements and identifying investors responsible for such movements.
 
 Sebi sources said senior executive director L K Singhvi was unhappy over the progress in integrating the markets even though considerable ground had been made on safety issues like collecting margins.
 
 Sebi was also miffed over the fact that none of the exchanges had been able to furnish details of the positions, volumes and evidence of any circular trading by their top 20 brokers, as demanded by the regulator two weeks back.
 
 ""None of the exchanges was able to give definite figures. They are not doing enough. The capability to detect abnormal price movements exists, but the issue is to what extent they use this capability. We have told them that they must pull up their socks,"" said a top Sebi official who was present at the meeting.
 
 Sebi also criticised the exchanges for their inability to to implement the earlier decision of relaxing price bands by 4 per cent after a 30-minute gap. The exchanges' excuse is that due to software-related problems it is not possible to electronically track the relaxation of these bands.
 
 But Sebi officials said the exchanges had agreed to implement this at an inter-exchange surveillance group. ""We have, in fact, been forced to defer the move indefinitely owing to their failure to address the software-related issues,"" said the official. Sebi had recently asked the exchanges to identify their top 20 brokers and gather data on their trade, volumes and detect indications of circular trading.
 
 About a month back, the regulator wrote a strong letter to all the exchanges, expressing its unhappiness over the way they were tackling unusual volatility in prices.
 
 Sebi chairman DR Mehta said the regulator was by and large satisfied with the exchanges since this time the regulator found exchanges to be ""far more alert"".
 
 But this, Sebi officials said, pertained more to the stock exchanges' slapping margins on scrips rather than actually detecting manipulations in scrips and reporting it to the regulator.

 ","The 15th Electric Power Survey conducted by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has forecast a huge deficit of 8,000 mw for the northern region by 2012, the end of the 11th Plan period.
 
 The Central Electricity Authority has also identified 6,000 mw to 7,000 mw of surplus power that could be exported to the north from the east. The remaining deficit will be met by the southern region.
 
 The southern region, which will have a surplus of about 2,500 mw by 2012, will be able to meet the marginal deficit that will be faced by the western region, according to the Central Electricity Authority forecast.
 
 In its recommendation, the Central Electricity Authority study has said: ""Increase in generating capacity in the eastern region for supplying loads in the northern region is a part of the least cost option. Transmission of a substantial amount of power (6,000-7,000 mw) is needed from the east to the north. The southern region is also expected to be surplus in power (1,000 mw-to-2500 mw) on account of the anticipated construction of a large number of projects by independent power producers."" 
 
 The surplus in the south, the study says, will be ""utilised in the western region partially, and transmitted via the western region, to the northern region"".
 
 The study has identified major transmission corridors for interconnections between the eastern and northern, western and northern, and western and southern regions.
 
 Suggesting an ""innovative method to enable development of these transmission highways"", the Central Electricity Authority  study has recommended two options: An ""interest-free loan with an extended repayment period to the Central Transmission Utility which would most likely build these lines, as was done in 1960s for construction of interstate lines to consolidate regional grid operation.""
 
 Second, the ""Government of India may fund the project with recovery of investment through back-loaded tariff so that the state utilities which are presently handicapped due to weak financial position, would not be further stressed to bear the heavy transmission charges on account of these bulk inter-regional transmission lines. These transmission highways are analogous to national highways and could be built as basic infrastructure projects.""
 
 In another interesting observation, the Central Electricity Authority study points out that that the Talcher-Kolar HVDC line will not be utilised as the southern region becomes surplus in power and will not need to import power from the eastern region.
 
 ""Accordingly, a considered view is required to be taken on generation addition programme in the southern region so as to ensure that the HVDC Talcher-Kolar bipole does not become redundant in the 10th and 11th Plan timeframe,"" the study says.

The Supreme Court has stayed the Delhi High Court order allowing Spectrum Power Generation Ltd (SPGL) to issue preferential shares for a mega power project in Andhra Pradesh.,"The Supreme Court has stayed the Delhi High Court order allowing Spectrum Power Generation Ltd (SPGL) to issue preferential shares for a mega power project in Andhra Pradesh. The apex court also asked the high court to speed up the hearing of the case pending before it.
 
 The appeal against the high court order was moved by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Spectrum Technologies US, which were promoters in the original project along with Jaya Foods. Later, Jaya Foods, a vermicelli firm owned by Krishna Rao, allegedly revoked the promoters' agreement. The litigation between the promoters over the issue is pending in the high court.
 
 Meanwhile, Spectrum Power Generation, the new firm that has stepped in place of Jaya Foods moved the high court and got an order to offer preferential shares. This has now been stopped by the Supreme Court bench comprising Justice V N Khare and Justice Santosh Hegde.
 
 Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing the US company, argued that it was willing to bring in enough funds for the project through equity. NTPC counsel Shanti Bhushan also submitted that it was willing to do the same.
 
 He said NTPC had acquired the land and got clearance for all the infrastructure facilities. However, they were ousted by the vermicelli firm which ""siphoned off"" the capital, counsel said. They cited reports by the Industrial Development Bank of India and the State Bank of India that opposed preferential shares plan by Spectrum Power Generation.
 
 P Chidambaram, counsel for Spectrum Power Generation, submitted that the shareholders must decide about the raising of capital. Under Section 81 of the Companies Act, it was mandatory that their meeting be called. The court cannot interfere in that.
 
 Moreover, the proportion of shares should not be changed while the high court is set to hear the case next week. He pleaded that SPGL be allowed to raise money through preferential shares from mutual funds.

"China Light and Power, promoters of the 1,000 mw Mangalore power project in Karnataka, is set to reduce its power tariff by nearly 18 to 20 per cent due to a decline in the price of coal.","China Light and Power, promoters of the 1,000 mw Mangalore power project in Karnataka, is set to reduce its power tariff by nearly 18 to 20 per cent due to a decline in the price of coal. At present, the company charges a tariff of Rs 2.4 per unit.
 
 Sources said the reduction in tariff was feasible due to the massive reduction in the price of imported coal_which has fallen by as much as 44 per cent. 
 
 They said the massive difference in coal prices could be incorporated into the power tariff as China Light and Power was ready to buy coal at spot rates instead of the long-term rate. 
 
 As compared to the $39 per tonne charged for the long-term supply of coal by the Mangalore Power Company (MPC), the spot rate has fallen to around $20 to $22 per tonne. Sources said the tariff, as worked out under the power purchase agreement, was Rs 2.4 per unit, of which fuel costs are around Rs 1 per unit.
 
 Under the present coal supply agreement cleared by the Karnataka state government for the Mangalore Power Company, 70 per cent of the total coal requirement has to be based on long-term contracts, 20 per cent on short-term contracts and only 10 per cent on the spot rate.
 
 The formula was worked out by the state electricity board after consultation with the promoters and financiers of the power venture.
 
 The board had wanted the Mangalore Power Company to avail of any decline in the spot prices of coal which would thereby be passed on to the consumers (as fuel costs are a pass through).
 
 However, negotiations between the state electricity board and Mangalore Power Company had even reached an impasse when the promoters insisted on long-term contracts.
 
 According to the promoters, their financiers preferred long-term contracts  since there was no perceived threat of the plant having to shut down due to the non-availability of fuel.
 
 The promoters would have to cough up liquidation damages to the board in this event, which the lenders wanted to avoid.
 
 As compared to the earlier contract_-the promoters now feel that it would not be very difficult for China Light and Power to pick up coal on arates and supply it to the site as it sources huge amounts of coal at spot rates for a variety of coal fired plants in the Asian region.
 
 Sources said informal discussions have already started with some consultants.

 Total grain output would have to be raised to nearly 300 million tonne, from the present around 200 million tonne, by 2020 to meet the demand of the burgeoning population, he said while inaugurating the five-day international conference on management of natural resources for sustainable agriculture in the 21st century, here, yesterday.
 
 Hailed as the man behind India's green revolution, Swaminathan said there was a need for a ""yield revolution"" now. It would be possible only if greater attention was paid to improving the efficiency of input use. A multi-disciplinary constraints analysis would have to be undertaken in different regions of the country to identify ways and means of bridging the gap between actual yield and the available potential with existing technology. He described the available untapped production reservoir as a ""blessing"" from this point of view.
 
 Expressing similar views, Indian Council of Agricultural Research director-general R S Paroda said farm research had shown that the real potential of the land even with the presently available technologies was three to four times the current output.

 ","Citibank has roped in Julio Ribeiro, former commissioner of police, Mumbai, as consultant to work out a fool-proof system to manage fraud in the banking industry, especially the credit card business.
 
 As part of the move, Citibank has tied up with the Bangalore police to shae information and expertise on fraud management in the financial services industry. The bank has taken similar steps in Mumbai, New Delhi, and is stopping over at Chennai for the next round.
 
 ""We are looking seriously at the option of bringing in retired police officials to accompany bank personnel in cases like car loan default which are becoming rampant,"" Ribeiro said at a press conference here yesterday.
 
 But Citibank fumbled on the question of legality of the suggested measures. Ribeiro accepted that going through courts is the right way but argued that the bank had every right to repossess property that was not being paid for, especially if the customer profile was unfavourable.
 
 Talking of trends in banking fraud, Citibank's Fraud Risk Management Director, Richard Parry, said there is a definite move towards sophisticated counterfeiting of credit cards all across Asia while the present fraud profile in India stays  limited to lost and stolen cards.
 
 Earlier, last week in Chennai, Richard Parry, fraud risk management director of Citibank, Asia-Pacific had warned that the credit card market in India is currently unprotected and if this continues white-collar crime will be on the rise. ""With India becoming a global economy and having access to global products and services, it is increasingly vulnerable to the risks of white collar crime,"" Parry said.
 
 With a significant presence in the card business, Citibank closely monitors trends in fraud and shares its experience with the regulatory authority of the concerned country.
 
 Even in India, the bank shares information with government agencies, customs and excise officials regularly. To tackle crime in the industry more effectively,  Citibank has initiated a programme to educate law enforcement agencies and the public on issues of fraud management with specific reference to the credit card business. It has joined hands with the city police to create a platform for sharing expertise and experiences of fraud management in the financial services industry in India.
 
 ""Any financial institution is best served by being proactive and in trying to minimise losses ahead of time. The methods of sophistication in customer usage is different and so are the methods employed by criminals to break the system,"" Parry said.

The gross cropped area in the country has hovered around 186 million hectares since the beginning of the 1990s.,"The gross cropped area in the country has hovered around 186 million hectares since the beginning of the 1990s. This has led to the general belief that farm land cannot be expanded further without sacrificing the forest areas that nobody would advise to do. However, this is not entirely so. Vast stretches of land, estimated at about 8.4 million hectares, are affected with alkalinity, salinity or other soil afflictions which are curable. Reclamation of afflicted soil  can help increase the cropped acreage perceptibly with obvious consequences for farm production, employment and income generation.
 
 The Karnal-based Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) has already evolved, and successfully demonstrated in the field, the technology for restoring salt-affected land to good health, making it fit for crop production. The usefulness of this technology has recently been endorsed in the social audit conducted by a specially appointed committee which was headed by former minister of state for agriculture Som Pal and had experts as well as politicians as members. The audit report has minced no words to point out that the reclamation technology is financially feasible and yields several direct and indirect benefits.
 
 Unfortunately, this technology is yet to be gainfully exploited to the desired extent. Only about eight lakh hectares, not even 10 per cent of the total salt-affected land, has so far been ameliorated. The audit committee found the benefits accruing from putting this hitherto barren land to agricultural use to be enormous. Besides, producing an additional 3.5 to 4.0 million tonnes of foodgrains, valued at around Rs 1,000 crore, it has generated an annual employment of 75 million mandays. Impact studies have also shown that land restoration spurs growth of many agro-based and auxiliary industries, such as poultry, dairying, farm machinery repair centres, etc., in the restored tracts. The reclamation of water-logged saline lands has been found to result in reduced incidence of diseases like malaria, filaria and water-borne maladies.
 
 The salt-related adversities of the land include alkalinity, salinity, inland water-logged salinity and coastal salinity. Alkaline lands, known variously as sodic, ""ussar"" or ""kallar"", found predominantly in the Indo-Gangetic plains where good quality water is available are the easiest to rejuvenate. All that is needed is to mix adequate quantity of gypsum in the soil to neutralise the excess sodium present in the form of sodium carbonate. A crop of rice, followed by wheat, can be raised in the very first year after reclamation. The repeated additions of gypsum helps fully restore the soil health in a few years.
 
 The saline soils which generally contain a surfeit of soluble salts like chlorides and sulphates of sodium and magnesium, can be reclaimed by leaching down the salts by using lots of water. Mercifully, most of such soils are permeable enough to facilitate this treatment.
 
 But in areas where the water table is already high, such as water-logged saline lands, sub-surface drainage has to be provided for restoring the salt balance. In areas where water availability is limited, the CSSRI experts have devised ways to collect and utilise rain water for this purpose.
 
 The management of coastal salinity that has crippled over three million hectares in a 50-km wide belt along the entire sea coast, however, is a little more complicated affair as it requires preventive embankments as well as field level water management. The CSSRI has worked out the specific need-based details of these measures.
 
 It would indeed be a pity if such a useful technology is allowed to remain on paper for want of necessary initiatives from state governments. Only a few states, such as Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Kerala, have shown some, albeit far from adequate, interest in it. The Centre can perhaps motivate them by providing higher budgetary support for land reclamation as recommended by the social audit committee.

The Congress yesterday reacted sharply to Constitution Review Commission member P A Sangma's statement that he would   raise the issue of persons of foreign origin being barred from occupying high positions in the country.,"The Congress yesterday reacted sharply to Constitution Review Commission member P A Sangma's statement that he would   raise the issue of persons of foreign origin being barred from occupying high positions in the country. The Congress said Sangma seemed unaware of the fact that members did not decide the terms of reference for the commission.
 
 ""Even the chairman of the Commission does not have such power, "" Congress spokesman Anil Shastri said yesterday. He said the terms decided by the Union Cabinet were too vague and ""open-ended"", and could not be supported by the Congress. ""We are open to any change provided they are specified,"" he said.
 
 P A Sangma had left the Congress along with Sharad Pawar to form the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) before the last Lok Sabha elections on the issue that persons of foreign origin should be barred from occupying the high offices of Prime Minister, the President and the Chief Justice of India.
 
 The Nationalist Congress Party  (NCP) had opposed the move the review the Constitution through a resolution adopted at its working committee meeting. Sangma, however, is already a part of the commission. Moreover, NCP president Sharad Pawar, whom Sangma could not contact before accepting the offer, also seems to be changing his stand on the review.
 
 Pawar said Sangma had not spoken to him till last evening. Pawar seemed to welcome the committee since it was headed by Justice M N Venkatachalaiah, who had made it clear that he would rather quit the panel than change the Constitution's basic features.

 ","IFCI Ltd has been forced to postpone the closing date of its rights issue to February 19, as the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), its principal shareholder, has sought more time to subscribe to its portion of the rights.
 
 IDBI holds 28 per cent stake in IFCI, and has to invest about Rs 100 crore in IFCI via the Rs 352 crore rights issue. The issue is critical for IFCI to maintain minimum capital adequacy levels. This is the second time IFCI has postponed its issue, which opened on December 23. The issue was earlier scheduled to close on January 21, but was rescheduled to February 14, on account of increased demand for split forms, according to an IFCI release earlier.
 
 Sources said the second postponement to February 19 was on account of more time being sought by IDBI to subscribe to the issue. Institutional investors are expected to pick up shares on the last day, because in the intervening time they could earn interest on the funds earmarked for the issue. Financial institutions led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) control nearly 60 per cent of IFCI's equity. Sources however added that the retail response to the issue has been good. The issue, which opened on December 23, is critical for IFCI to meet higher capital adequacy of 9 per cent of risk weighted assets by March, 2000. As on March 31, 1999, the FI's capital adequacy was 8.37 per cent. 
 
 The rights issue of equity shares is being made at par in the ratio of 1:1, aggregating Rs 353 crore. The FI said the issue is aimed at boosting tier-1 capital in order to maintain the capital adequacy. The IFCI scrip is currently trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) at about Rs 12.

 ""I met the Chief Minister and conveyed that we are going ahead with our plan and there is no double thinking on re-opening Sahaganj on March 11,"" Shukla said.

"Imagine a situation when a company, after acquiring nearly 81 per cent stake in a firm through negotiated deals, has failed to get the remaining 19 per cent shareholding by public offer.","Imagine a situation when a company, after acquiring nearly 81 per cent stake in a firm through negotiated deals, has failed to get the remaining 19 per cent shareholding by public offer. And that too, after offering a price 1,807 per cent higher than the ruling market rate.
 
 Sounds strange? It's happened to Henkel Spic India, the joint venture of the German detergents major Henkel with Spic, to acquire minority shareholding in Calcutta Chemical Company (Calchem). The reason: nearly nine per cent of the 19 per cent minority shareholders are said to be dead or untraceable.
 
 In addition, sensing that Henkel Spic India, which is keen to get 100 per cent control over Calchem, may offer something more soon, several shareholders declined to sell their entire holdings at one go.
 
 As a result, Henkel Spic has got the management control but falls short of the desired 100 per cent stake in Calchem.
 
 Henkel Spic, which had acquired Shaw Wallace's 55 per cent stake in Calchem at a rate of Rs 267 per share more than a year ago, has recently purchased nearly 26 per cent shareholding of the city-based Krishna Das Paul at a negotiated price. Then it came out with the public offer, priced at Rs 267 per share, to acquire the minority shareholding. The offer closed last month.
 
 A Calchem source said Henkel Spic has got nothing to lose as it has already acquired the management control in the company. "" Henkel Spic came out with the offer to conform to the Sebi norms. Those who did not opt for the offer will lose as the scrip will be delisted from the bourses soon. ""The Sebi norms make mandatory delisting for the companies which have less than 20 per cent shares with the minority shareholders.
 
 Henkel Spic officials could not be reached. However, an expert in corporate law and management said, as Calchem will not be termed a 100 per cent subsidiary of Henkel Spic,  it will cause ""some technical problems"" to the latter."" Having a 76 per cent stake is enough to effectively manage a company. So no point in acquiring 91 per cent stake if one fails to get the 100 per cent control, "" he added.

 Security prices see-sawed yesterday before falling back to Saturday's closing levels by the end of the day. In the morning gilts went up by 50-80 paise at the long end before falling by a similar amount in the afternoon session.
 
 Interest rate in the overnight interbank call money market opened at around 10 per cent and stayed steady at this level for most of the day. Towards the close, call money rates fell to 9.3-9.5 per cent as demand for funds tapered off.
 
 Dealers said this sort of a situation was likely to continue with overnight call rates remaining steady at around 10 per cent and security prices being volatile. In the last month itself, security yields have fallen by 100 basis points at the long end.
 
 ""Once Rs 5,000 crore which flowed out of the system due to the auction returns to the system, call money rates should stabilise at around 8-8.5 per cent levels. If a bank rate cut is announced in the budget itself, overnight rates would see a further fall,"" said a money market dealer.
 
 Rumours of a bank rate and cash reserve ratio cut has already resulted in the market discounting these factors in advance. ""In fact, now some bankers have started expecting a 2 per cent bank rate cut which is highly unlikely under such circumstances,"" said a debt market dealer in a nationalised bank.
 
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has put the 12.32 per cent 2011 government security on its open market operations window at a sale price of Rs 112.75. This is in line with the current price of the security in the secondary market.
 
 With security prices being as volatile as they are, there is a growing fear in the market over the consequences of a reversal in price movement. ""This could very much happen if the budget does not meet the expectations of the market. Prices of securities are reaching new highs everyday and the downside could be expected to be as fast as the rise has been,"" said a debt market dealer.
 
 Dealers are of the opinion that the growth in prices needs to be checked as the market has reached uncomfortable levels. Many dealers would be relieved to see falling prices at this stage. ""A huge bubble appears to have built up in the current scenario,"" said a money market dealer.

 The spot rupee weakened yesterday following inflows of corporate demand into the market. However, it recovered later in the day to close at 43.62 as compared to 43.63 on Friday.
 
 The swaps market remained range-bound, but dealers expect it to tighten in the following days.
 
 The spot traded in an intra-day range of 43.62 to 43.64. As the market opened in the morning, dealers said that a large amount of corporate demand entered into the market from some corporates. However, later in the day the demand tapered off and the rupee recovered to 43.62. ""There is a feeling in the market that the rupee could tighten and so there are some corporates who are covering in the market,"" said a dealer.
 
 Forward premiums tightened also as paying came in from importers looking to cover at low levels of premiums. ""The current levels of 2.75 per cent are very attractive for corporates and this level has become a floor level where paying comes into the market,"" said a dealer. ""Also call money  rates have not eased and are still in tight to a certain extent, so forwards are beginning to move up,"" he said.
 
 Last week, despite a tightening in call rates premiums remained range-bound with the market seeing it only as a temporary phenomenon. However, now dealers say that the call rates could continue for some time and this has caused the premiums to move up gradually.
 
 ""There is little market-moving news right now and, therefore, players are in a cautious mood,"" said a dealer with a private bank.
 
 For tomorrow, the spot rupee is expected to be in a range of 43.62 to 43.65, while premiums are seen in a range of 2.75 to 3 per cent for the six month maturity.

 There is an internal generation of Rs 50 crore and Rs 24.5 crore of unsecured loans from the promoters, according to senior state government sources.
 
 The project is a modern unit for value-addition to steel with cold rolling facilities of 150,000 tonne per annum, and galvanising facilities of 120,000 tpa, based on the latest technology. It has an equity share capital of Rs 22.5 crore.
 
 Bhushan Industries plans to export 40 per cent of the output to neighbouring countries and 60 per cent will be sold in the domestic market.
 
 The unit is proposed in view of the large savings in freight costs to cater to the vast market existing in eastern and north-eastern parts of the country with substantial annual consumption and also cater to the export market in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Myanmar, Bhutan and to South Africa, via Singapore.
 
 In particular, the cold rolled-full hard steel will be exported to Bangladesh where a huge demand exists for the product, by numerous units engaged in galvanising at small scales.
 
 The focus shall be mainly on galvanised/plain corrugated sheets primarily for product applications like roofing and construction activities.
 
 Bhushan Industries has plants located in Punjab, Chandigarh and Delhi.
 
 Shamon Ispat, part of the flagship company Shamon Engineering Corp, has also recently set up a Rs 33-crore cold rolling unit in Haldia. It will produce cold rolled steel sheet in coiled form.

 ","Bank of India (BoI) has made a profit of Rs 125 crore in the current fiscal so far on account of its trading in the government securities compared with a total profit of Rs 26 crore in this segment for the whole of last year.
 
 This was announced by BoI officials at a press conference here in Mumbai yesterday.
 
 V H Ramakrishnan, general manager, attributed the profits to ""buoyant conditions in the securities market.""
 
 Officials also disclosed that the bank would not have to suffer any losses on account of the assured returns scheme offered by Bank of India Mutual Fund.
 
 The assured returns scheme of the BoI, called BoI Double Square Plus, offered investors who bought the unit in 1990 at a price of Rs 100, a guaranteed return of Rs 400 by this year.
 
 ""There were apprehensions last year that the bank would have to suffer a big loss since the net asset value last year was Rs 233 - far short of Rs 400,"" said Ramakrishnan. ""However because of the excellent conditions in the capital market and a reshuffling of the portfolio, the NAV is currently Rs 413. We are confident that the bank will not have to suffer a loss on account of this scheme,"" he added.
 
 He disclosed that investors had been assured of a return of Rs 300 for the scheme in 1998. ""Because the net asset value was lower than that, the bank made up the difference by giving a cheque of Rs 32 crore to the mutual fund last year.""
 
 Speaking about the bank's centralised banking project, BoI's deputy general manager (IT), K. Ramakrishnan said that the bank was spending about Rs 100 crore to network its five hundred computerised branches to a central data centre.
 
 This would allow a customer to access his account from any of these branches. The plan envisages a pilot run with two branches later this year. ""The remaining branches will be gradually computerised and the project will be completed by 2002,"" he said. The bank  has also launched a new floating rate deposit scheme for corporates and high net-worth customers. The deposit would be for one year with a minimum deposit of Rs 1 crore. The interest rate on the deposit would be set quarterly at spread of 25 basis points over the 91-day treasury bill rate.

"As part of the revamp plan, it is dropping non-performing brands and focusing on key ones.","As part of the revamp plan, it is dropping non-performing brands and focusing on key ones. Shubha Sethuraman reports.
 
 On new brand launches, the company will, in a clear break from the past, not launch any new product on an all-India. basis. 'We will tightly monitor new launches. Any new brand will first be tested in a small region. And only if it is successful, Will we contemplate a national launch'
 
 Parry's Confectionery Ltd, part of the Chennai-based Rs 3,100 crore Murugappa group, recently announced plans to restructure its business in view of increasing competition from domestic and overseas players, erosion in marketshare and poor performance by some brands.
 
 As part of the revamp plan, the company will drop or recon-figure brands which are not performing up to expectations and will focus instead on managing and building key brands.
 
 Says Sournitra Ghatak, vice-president, ""We needed to take a relook at business and make some tough decisions to regain lost ground."" Brands with future potential are, therefore, to be put in the ""project management mode"" with clear trigger Points.
 
 The company has reason to be concerned. In 1999 alone the company's marketshare declined from 28.5 per cent to 25 per cent Sales during the third quarter of the current fiscal amounted to Rs 17.89 crore as against Rs 34.28 crore achieved during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. The company reported a net loss of Rs 18.14 crore during the quarter.
 
 N C Venugopal, president, attributes the drop in sales to the rationalisation measures undertaken by Parry's during the current fiscal including the withdrawal of some brands - Mr Peanut, Tryme, Anytime - and a switch from credit to	cash transactions with channei partners.
 
 The cost of restructuring has so far worked out to roughly Rs 15 crore for the company.
 
 ""Thee onetime write-off hurts but it is in keeping with our new philosophy of strengthening only the key brands. Supporting many fledgling brands nationally over a long period has proved to be a costly exercise and highly ineffective as a strategy for Parry's and its channel partners"" Venugopal says.
 
 Consequently, the product portfolio has been drastically pruned to include 12 brands as against 33 in the past. This will also enable the company to 
 direct its adspend at key brands. Over the last couple of years the company had been spreading its resources thin on promoting both strong and weak brands.
 
 Parry's has earmarked Rs 9 crore for advertising this year and as part of the new promotional strategy: Coffy Bite will be aggressively pushed in new avtaars of Coffy Bite bar at one rupee and sticpack at Rs 5. Lacto King, pioneer in the lacto segment, will be relaunched in a big way. Madras Cafe is expected to establish Parry's as the leader in the coffee segment and hence will get more attention.
 
 The market can be segmented on the basis of flavour and price. The key preferences are milk, fruit, coffee, coconut and elaichi.
 
 Milk and elaichi are among the fastest growing segments. While fruit is growing marginally, the coffee segment has remained stagnant and the coconut segment has actually recorded negative growth.
 
 The various price points are 25 paise, 50 paise, one rupee, one rupee plus. According to an ORG study, growth in the 50 paise segment has remained stagnant while in the 25 paise segment it has been marginal.
 
 Over the years, direct coverage had dropped due to a lack of focus on secondary offtake. Shift of focus from secondary to primary sales, extended credit and weak merchandising were detrimental.
 
 Ghatak is confident that the new look sales team headed by K S Venugopal (formerly of Hindustan Lever), who has recently taken over is general sales manager, which has been put in place to focus on the retail market will achieve the clearly defined targets.
 
 Besides, being a pioneer in  sugar boiled confectionery in India, Parry's has a wealth of experience in its people (900 employees in all) who will spearhead the new growth strategy.
 
 The rural market, largely dominated by the unorganised sector, has been identified as a thrust area. ""Shakthi"" a malt-milk toffee priced at 25 paise has been specifically launched with the rural market in mind.
 
 ""We may not make adequate money on ""Shakthi"" but iL will go a long way in capturing market-share and establishing a presence for the company in the rural market,"" he says.
 
 The unorganised sector is poised to grow at 33 per cent annually while the organised market is expected to register a 10 per cent growth. The organised market is currently estimated at 79,000 tonnes.
 
 ""Penetration of the rural market will form an important part of our growth strategy in future,"" states Ghatak.
 
 Besides, opportunities for growth have also been identified in the northern and eastern markets. Currently, 50 per cent of sales comes from the south. However, with a reinforced distribution network in place in these, regions, he hopes to reduce its dependence on the southern market.
 
 On new brand launches, the company will, in a clear break from the past, not launch any new product on an all-India basis. ""We will tightly monitor new launches. Ary new branO will first be tested in a small region. And only if it is successful, will we contemplate a national launch,"" Ghatak emphasises.
 
 In the past Parry's has burnt its fingers by taking on the national market rightaway. If the brand was slow moving their the exercise turned out to be particularly wasteful.
 
 Besides an overhaul of sales and marketing, Parry's is also in the process of rationalising . production at its plants in Nellikuppam and Manapakkam. In this, it will be assisted by TECHNET. headed by Ashok Ganguly (former chairman of HLL). This will entail a review of manufacturing processes and cost.
 
 With the idea of bringing in any additional resource into its business, Parry's has disinvested in group companies - TI Diamond & Chain, Cholarnandalam and Carborundum Universal. This has garnered Rs 7.8 crore.
 
 Although the restructuring exercise emphasises sales and marketing, it covers the entire, gamut of operations. Says, Venugopal, ""every aspect of business needs to be covered as they all have a role to play in improving the bottomline.""

 Whenever any sophisticated equipment is bought from a foreign country then the Indian party necessarily requires the technical knowhow back-up along with the equipment. The Indian party may also like to have the benefit of technical services for commissioning and setting up of the imported equipment. It is also desirable to have performance guarantees.
 
 Therefore, the foreign party, besides the supply of equipment, may also provide technical drawings and operational manual for which the basic and detailed engineering is generally done outside India.
 
 However, some activities in India are nevertheless unavoidable to ensure proper commissioning and functioning of the imported machinery. In most cases an attempt is made by the Indian tax authorities to tax the income arising out of the supply of plant and machinery on the ground that the sale of such equipment is in fact effectively completed in India.

 ","Riding high on a string of impressive performances, the city-based Indus League Clothing Ltd is gearing for the launch of a top-end western women's wear range by the year end and also finalising stock option plans for its manufacturing and marketing associates.
 
 ""There's no real brand in the women's wear segment, so we have to ensure that we get it right the first time,"" Indus League managing director, Sriram Srinivasan, said.
 
 As part of the effort, the company is also setting up a 4000 sq.ft design studio in Bangalore where designers and visual mechandisers will work together to fine-tune the product design and finish.
 
 The company also unveiled their Employee Stock Option (Esop) Plan here yesterday. Called Indus League Employees Growth Options 2000 (ILEGO 2000), the scheme, with a base figure of 500 stock options, will be offered to every employee who has put in six months of service.
 
 The first Indian clothing company to receive venture capital funding, Indus League will offer over 7 per cent of the fully diluted equity through ILEGO-2000.
 
 ""We will have special stock options for employees who have sacrificed higher salaries elsewhere to join us,  contributed substantially and stayed committed to the company's growth,"" finance and HR director, Uday Kumar, said.
 
 In the 78-member strong company, 28 early-bird employees have already received their stock option grant letters, and the value of their stocks has already shot up by 350 per cent, Kumar said.
 
 Just seven months into the launch of its brands, Indus League is expected to achieve sales of over Rs 27 crore in 1999-2000, more than 60 per cent higher than its original business plan projections based on which it received its funding from Draper International and Dalmia Cements.
 
 ICICI Venture, which valued Indus League at Rs 50 crore, picked up a significant but undisclosed stake in the company in January 2000.
 
 Launched in April 1999 by Sriram Srinivasan and seven other professionals from the garment industry, Indus League launched their two original brands - Indigo Nation and Scullers - within five months in India. Both these are also marketed in seven countries in West Asia and Sri Lanka.

Global consulting major Arthur Andersen will also play the role of an incubator for the infotech and Internet start-up companies in India.,"Global consulting major Arthur Andersen will also play the role of an incubator for the infotech and Internet start-up companies in India. The leading consulting company is all set to fund Internet start-ups in India as part of its global strategy to promote information technology, telecom ventures and Internet companies in a big way, said senior company official. 
 
 The company has set aside half-a-billion dollars to plunge into incubator's role world-wide.
 
 ""This is as part of the company's commitment to play a key role in the coming years in the Internet arena,"" Peter Raymond, head (corporate/privatisation) of Arthur Andersen's global communication practice, informed.
 
 Raymond also said that the half-a-billion-dollar fund announced on January 24, is aimed at promoting ideas. ""For that, there's no geographic barrier. We are open to funding anyone approaching us with a good idea. We will be pleased to take up the role of an incubator,"" he said.
 
 According to him, as part of its India-specific activities, Arthur Andersen would soon come out with an India-specific plan with a detailed outlay and with specific fund allocation. ""The incubator programme was announced recently and we would form a group here in India to work out an area-specific strategy,"" he said.
 
 He, however, did not point out the specific details of its incubator role in India. ""We are in the process of working out the policies, project specification and legalities. Once these become clear we would roll out our project in India,"" he pointed out. ""We are expecting to come out with a concrete plan soon,"" he added.

"The ministry of steel, on a request from Russian firm Tyzhpromexport (TPE), has extended the February deadline for the finalisation of the Rs 800 crore TPE joint venture proposal for Indian Iron and Steel Co Ltd (Iisco).","The ministry of steel, on a request from Russian firm Tyzhpromexport (TPE), has extended the February deadline for the finalisation of the Rs 800 crore TPE joint venture proposal for Indian Iron and Steel Co Ltd (Iisco). The ministry has asked TPE to reach a decision by March 31, 2000, when Iisco's revival plan is scheduled for hearing before the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).
 
 If TPE fails to deliver by March 31 the ministry would have to place an alternative plan for reviving Iisco before the BIFR.
 
 Senior steel ministry sources said, ""TPE has been unable to reach a final decision so far due to internal political problems in Russia. However, since they have sought an extension of the deadline, the steel ministry is prepared to wait, but only till March 31. TPE would actually have to come up with an answer before March 31, since the BIFR hearing is scheduled on that date.""
 
 Steel minister Dilip Ray had announced in November 1999 that the government would give TPE till February-end to finalise its joint venture proposal, failing which the government would explore other options.
 
 The TPE proposal envisages bringing in Rs 800 crore either as equity or loan, using the rupee-rouble escrow account.
 
 Last year, Steel Authority of India Ltd's (SAIL) Rs 2107 crore revival plan for Iisco, which envisaged the participation of TPE as an equity partner, was sent to the Russian government for clearance.
 
 This year, TPE submitted a revised version of the proposal for vetting by the government of India, which envisages majority participation by TPE and a total investment of Rs 800 crore. Under the new plan, Iisco's steelmaking capacity is proposed to be raised from 0.3 million tonne to 0.6 million tonne. While the Indian government has approved the revised proposal, the Russian side is yet to come through with their clearances.
 
 ""If the Russian side does not come through with a decision even by March, the only way TPE would get a further extension is if the BIFR extends its date of hearing"", said steel ministry sources.

 Alyque Padamsee, creative consultant to McCann Erikson India told Business Standard: ""The agency is undergoing a re-engineering process which will be complete in a couple of months.""
 
 The agency with a turnover of $16 billion worldwide, has already signed three IT start-ups in India. ""Bigness allows many things under one roof"" said Padamsee and this is exactly what McCann is endeavouring at. The agency is all set to enter into web advertising and portals.
 
 Stan Rapp, of McCann (worldwide) a specialist in customer relationship management, was in Mumbai to facilitate the formation of the consumer interest division.
 
 Padamsee has also become communications advisor to the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu. The main idea is to improve communication between Chandrababu Naidu and his own bureaucrats, investors (both Indian and foreign) and the people of Andhra Pradesh. Among the three layers Padamsee identifies the bureaucratic one to be toughest. 
 
 He has suggested that ""wife power"" be infused into this layer. ""If the wife and children are involved the idea would be more accepted by the bureaucrats who are used to keeping the levers of power in their control"" he said. To communicate ideas to the masses of ""Cyberbad"", the state will have Internet connection at every street corner and it is through this medium that Padamsee will reach out to people at the grassroots level.
 
 Lastly, the advertising guru feels that it will not be a very arduous task too woo investors to a state where the chief minister and his cabinet are ready to welcome them and adapt to the market forces. Padamsee has already obtained a SWOT analysis of the state from the industries minister and is studying it.

 Going by Forbes' 1999 ranking of the 10 richest businessmen, Premji is preceded only by Bill Gates with an estimated networth of $ 90 billion, Warren Buffett with $36 billion and Paul Allen with $30 billion. 
 
 Premji's personal wealth is based on his 75 per cent stake in Wipro. His net worth has risen a whopping 133 per cent to Rs 1,11,721 crore in just over a month. To put this in perspective, he now accounts for one-tenth of the BSE's total market capitalisation, which is over Rs 11,00,000 crore. 
 
 The Wipro scrip hit the circuit-filter to close at Rs 6,500.40 yesterday. 
 
 The sharp rise in Wipro's market price is attributed to its excellent third-quarter performance and its thrust on new areas like Net-related technologies and telecom software. The tieup with global software major Microsoft has also fuelled investor sentiment.
 
 Premji isn't the only one enjoying good fortune. The market rally over the past month has helped members of the BS Billionaires Club add to their already substantial kitty.

The government is planning to overhaul the board of directors of public sector banks to restrict membership to government nominees and shareholder-representatives from the public.,"The government is planning to overhaul the board of directors of public sector banks to restrict membership to government nominees and shareholder-representatives from the public. The move would keep away trade union representatives from directly occupying positions on the boards.
 
 The proposal is likely to come up before the Cabinet in the next few weeks. The move may evoke stiff resistance from the unions.
 
 In the run-up to the board revamp, the government last month dropped all non-official directors from the boards of all public sector banks and set a three-year tenure for them.
 
 The composition of public sector bank boards has changed gradually over the past year, with the government giving permission for induction of a greater number of shareholder-representatives.
 
 Corporation Bank was the first to induct public representatives on its board, followed by Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of India and Bank of Baroda. Dena Bank was the last one to induct shareholder-representatives through a secret ballot, and selected four that included former Uco Bank director S Ravi, Avinash Dalal and Subhas Chandra Wadhwa. Several other banks are planning to go public as well such as Allahabad Bank and Punjab & Sind Bank. Syndicate Bank made its maiden public offer late last year. Sources said the move to revamp the banks' boards and also their organisational structure is part of a bigger plan of a effecting a major structural change in the PSU banking fraternity, that includes divestment of government stake below 51 per cent.

 In a related move, Sebi yesterday informed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) about some banks that have been extending credit or providing bank guarantees to brokers at very low margins.
 
 Sources said Sebi was concerned over possible exploitation of the banking system by brokers taking large exposures on the back of guarantees. That is why it said all brokers would have to ensure that 50 per cent of all capital and margins furnished by them were in cash by March-end.
 
 The sources said that the regulator was of the view that while it could take steps like slapping higher margins, there was little it could do to prevent misuse of bank funds. 
 
 The NSE has already held informal discussions with some of its clearing banks and told them that considering the overheated state of the markets, they should review their credit limits to brokers. NSE currently has four clearing banks__HDFC Bank, Global Trust Bank, Canara Bank and IndusInd Bank__but two of these banks which have been aggressive in extending credit to brokers have been asked to review their guidelines, said top NSE sources.
 
 In a related move, Sebi chairman DR Mehta on Monday is believed to have taken up the issue with senior RBI officials of some banks extending bank guarantees, overdrafts and loan against shares, at low margins which could be misused by some brokers to build up large positions and in the process manipulate the markets. 
 
 Although Mehta declined to comment on the issue, sources close to him said that RBI has informed Sebi that it is looking into the issue and could shortly take some measures.

 Takashi Asamura, representative director and executive vice president, Nippon Steel, said, ""We would like to have some opportunities for business in this country and we want good relations with Tata Steel for exchange of marketing and development information.""
 
 Asamura added that India has a brighter future in the global steel market than Japan, primarily due to the availability of huge raw material reserves and cheap labour, and the only solution for the Japanese steel industry's survival is technology renovation.
 
 Tata Steel's knowledge partnership with Nippon would continue till the ramp-up stage, till which time the steel major would require the Japanese company's expertise in developing its CR products. Tata Steel is contemplating on renewing the contract even beyond the ramp-up stage. Till the ramp-up stage, Tata Steel plans to provide CR steel to prospective customers, such as automobile manufacturers, on a trial basis, a company spokesperson said.
 
 The 1.2 million-tonne capacity CR complex is due for trial commissioning in May 2000 and the galvanising line has already been commissioned in January.
 
 According to the spokesperson, ""Tata Steel has identified Nippon Steel as the knowledge leader with respect to CR and this tie-up has brought Nippon Steel from a stand-off position as a competitor of Tata Steel to a mutually beneficial strategic partner. It makes sense on every front, including marketing, because Nippon Steel is one of the largest suppliers of steel to auto makers."" However, both Asamura and B Muthuraman, vice-president (Project Gopalpur and CRM), Tata Steel, emphasised that the knowledge tie-up is in no way a forerunner to a marketing collaboration in the future. ""Mutual benefits would be accrued in terms of sharing of market and product technology information. Tata Steel, for instance, would help Nippon to understand the requirements of the India market more effectively,"" said Asamura.
 
 The future of CR, according to Asamura, would be in more environment-friendly products, with wider usage and recyclability properties and simplification in process. Tata Steel need not worry about excess capacities in the CR market because dominance in the market would be determined on the basis of strength of products.

 ","Cholamandalam Cazenove Mutual Fund is to reposition its equity scheme Chola Freedom Growth as a technology fund, and will hence be called Chola Freedom Technology.
 
 Ved Prakash Chaturvedi, Cholamandalam Cazenove AMC's new CEO, informed that the fund's NAV has shown a 45 per cent growth in the last 60 days.
 
 ""Given the market situation and our belief that technology will be a driver of growth in the future in key industries, Chola Freedom Growth is being repositioned as a technology fund,"" says Chaturvedi.
 
 As required by law, the company is now in the process of informing its subscribers of the change in orientation of the fund, besides giving them an option to exit if they so desire.
 
 The restructuring exercise and the formal name change of the scheme is to take effect from March 6, 2000.
 
 Given the fund's impressive performance in the recent past, Chaturvedi holds out the promise of a `hefty dividend' in the near future to prospective investors who wish to stay on.
 
 As for the bond funds, Cholamandalam has the country's only AAA rated income fund (funds from the scheme are invested solely in bonds that get a AAA rating from Crisil) and this rating has been maintained since its inception in March 1997.
 
 Funds invested in Chola Triple Ace, has returned 30.87 per cent, 18.76 per cent and 15.35 per cent in the last one, three and six months (on an annualised basis), respectively.
 
 Thus, despite its inherent `high safety' tag, returns for investors in the scheme have been attractive going against the conventional `low-risk-low-returns' theory, says Chaturvedi.
 
 Three years from now, ""We would like to be among the top five players in the industry,"" he said.
 
 Repositioning apart, the AMC also realises that, at present, it does not have a `complete product basket'. With just one equity and two bond funds, there is an urgent need to have schemes that will appeal to a cross section of investors, Chaturvedi explains.

"Modular Consultants, promoters for the country's first integrated food processing park coming up at Dankuni, West Bengal, are scouting for a strategic financial partner for the Rs 204 crore project.","Modular Consultants, promoters for the country's first integrated food processing park coming up at Dankuni, West Bengal, are scouting for a strategic financial partner for the Rs 204 crore project. The project is expected to attract a total investment of Rs 2,000 crore.
 
 The project is expected to be executed in multiple phases. While Rs 96 crore will be invested in the first phase, Rs 108 crore will be deployed in the subsequent phases. The promoters have tied up with Eco-Vision Inc of Canada for the research and development centre, Frozen Foods Ltd, (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation, Japan) for the cold storage and Romtech of Australia for master control centre.
 
 The project has recently been sanctioned Rs 15 crore from Hudco, along with a central government grant of Rs 3 crore approved and partly disbursed for infrastructure development.
 
 Snowman, a joint venture between HLL, Mitsubishi and Amalgam for development of cold storage unit has been allotted a plot within the park, and construction work is under way.
 
 The rationale behind setting up this park, say senior official sources, is that West Bengal produces 27 per cent of the pineapples, 28 per cent of potatoes and 17 per cent of the rice production in the country.
 
 ""Food processing is a sunrise industry and a vast potential lies untapped. It is yet to realise its full potential"", said a government official.
 
 Some factors restricting the sector's growth are fragmented production centres, and absence of any effective intermediary agency such as producers' cooperatives. Cold chain infrastructure required for transportation and storage also needs major augmentation.
 
 The proposed food park will provide basic infrastructure facilities like cold storage, generated necessary volumes for direct marketing, thus eliminating multiple intermediary stages. The complete project shall be in 530 acres of land, out of which 70 acres have already been purchased.

The government comes into the financial picture in three ways.,"The government comes into the financial picture in three ways. First, it has a monopoly of currency supply. Second, it is a substantial borrower. Finally, it regulates financial markets.
 
 In all these three respects, the Indian government's influence on the economy has been negative. It borrows too much; and its borrowing agent, Reserve Bank, wants to keep down the cost of borrowing. So it borrows as much as possible by issuing currency, which are zero-interest bonds that have never to be repaid. Reserve Bank routinely raises money supply by 16-17 per cent a year -- about 10 per cent more than the growth of real production. Even if we add a couple of per cent for increasing monetisation, Reserve Bank, plans for a high rate of inflation. Inflation was 7 per cent till the 1970s, then it went up to an average of 11 per cent. In the past year it has come down to 2-3 per cent; nothing has changed in monetary policy or in the government's policy of pushing up foodgrain policies. There is no change in the Reserve Bank's rate of money creation, so sooner or later inflation is likely to return to its trend level of 10-12 per cent.
 
 When it comes to regulation, the government's ownership of banks and financial institutions leads it to favour them. Thus all of them have high levels of bad debts, and are in effect bankrupt. The correct thing to do with bankrupt firms would be to close them down. But because they belong to the government, it has done everything except close them down. The Bank of Karad was milked by sharebrokers who were later caught in the Bank scam; the government merged it with another bank. Then Manmohan Singh poured new capital into bankrupt banks -- capital which ultimately had to be financed by taxpayers in the form of higher taxes or by the general population in the form of higher prices. When the UTI bankrupted its US-64 by injudicious speculation, Yashwant                Sinha bailed it out by giving massive tax concessions to investors in shares and in mutual funds. These are not poor people. If they pay less tax, someone else must pay more -- or there must be more inflation, or both.
 
 Reserve Bank has worked actively to ensure that they do not have to face competition. In the first flush of reforms, Manmohan Singh asked Reserve Bank to license new, private banks. It did license some; quite a few of those were owned by government financial institutions. It received over a hundred applications; it is still sitting on them. Then arose a new threat to government banks -- non-banking financial companies. Starting with the report of the A C Shah Committee, Reserve Bank has seen to it that only a handful of the 40,000-odd NBFCs survived; it has effectively contained their threat to the banks. 
 
 Apart from the tax concessions on dividends and capital gains, the government has not tampered too much with the equity market; in fact, the market has greatly improved over the 1990s. Two influences have been important: the setting up of the National Stock Exchange, owned by government financial institutions, and the transfer of regulatory powers from the finance ministry to Securities and Exchange Board of India. Both have turned out to be highly positive developments.
 
 Thus, policy mismanagement lies largely on the side of debt, and concerns the government's handling of banks and lending institutions. Here there has to be more, fairer and more equal competition; and there will not be as long as they remain under government ownership. Hence their privatisation must be the first priority of reforms.
 
 However, privatisation must steer clear of two dangers. First, the banks and FIs must not pass under the control of major borrowers -- for instance, industrialists. In many countries -- including Pakistan --government banks were sold to industrialists, who borrowed from them and made them bankrupt, and then went back to the government for a bail-out. It is possible to minimise this possibility by ensuring that a shareholder or a group of them does not dominate a bank; there can also be rules about who may not own bank shares. Reserve Bank knows all about such restrictions, and would have no difficulty in introducing them. But there is another way: namely, to pass on the ownership to depositors. This is the principle of mutual societies, which predate companies. Mutual insurance companies and mortgage banks in the West are being demutualised and turned into corporate institutions under the pressure of their owners; the owners prefer to own saleable shares instead of illiquid units. But mutualisation may be a good first step to ensure that the banks do not immediately fall into the hands of powerful borrowers.
 
 Second, the market structure is all wrong. There are four huge long-term financial institutions. Of them, two -- IDBI and ICICI -- are too large; they need to be demerged into at least half a dozen institutions. One -- IFCI -- is bankrupt; it should be wound down. The last, UTI, is at last facing healthy competition from private mutual funds; although it is too large, it will cease to be so under the force of competition. Amongst the banks, the State Bank is too large, and should be demerged into half a dozen smaller banks. Of the rest, the bankrupt ones like the United Commercial must be sold off piece by piece; those that are not can be left alone. 
 
 But the most important point is to introduce open structures -- structures that allow that entry and exit of new banks, financial institutions and insurance companies. Reserve Bank finds this idea highly unwelcome; it would rather limit the numbers in the hope that it can thereby contain competition and stave off bankruptcies. The insurance regulator is equally against competition. But as I have earlier written, the way to stave off bank bankruptcies is not by limiting competition, but by insisting that every bank writes off doubtful debts out of deposits as soon as they arise. Banks would in effect provide two separate services. One would be to hold cash for depositors; on these cash accounts, the banks would pay no interest at all, and may even charge interest. But they would also offer to invest the deposits for their clients, and offer various options of lending them out to borrowers that vary in risk, and of investing the deposits in marketable securities. Thus banks would offer customers a number of investment options just like mutual funds, and like mutual funds, the banks would pass on the capital risk, including the risk of bad debt, to the investors. An investor would wants safety can keep his money in a cash account; if he wants a return, he must take risk, just like an investor in equity. That would eliminate the risk of bank failure -- and the need for Reserve Bank to restrict competition. All it would have to do is to ensure that banks keep proper accounts and promptly write off losses. The banks' depositors, who would bear the losses, would take their money out of inefficient banks and make sure the banks close down.

 Dow Corning already owned 49.9 per cent equity in USLL. The latter was established in January 1992 as a joint venture company with Gandhi & Associates Investment Ltd having 60 per cent equity, while the remaining was held by Dow Corning. In July 1998, Dow Corning hiked its stake from 40 to 49.9 per cent.
 
 Avinash Gandhi, chairman of Dow Corning India Ltd, said that the US company has bought the shares four times of its original equity. However, he refused to disclose the amount at which Dow Corning bought the remaining 51.1 per cent equity in USLL, thereby making it a wholly owned subsidiary.
 
 Rich Hoover, vice-president and executive director of Dow Corning Corporation, said that the parent company plans to make Dow Corning India the manufacturing hub for Singapore, Thailand and China. He said that the US company plans to double investments in India within the next two to three years. However, the company was not looking at acquisitions as growth in India.
 
 Dow Corning will integrate the current USLL supply system into its global supply chain, which will better enable the company to serve its regional customers' growing demand for improved quality of products, competitive pricing and dependable supply.
 
 Initially, Dow Corning will have to import a few products. However, the company is working on a two-three products to be manufactured at USLL's facility at Tarapur district Thane, Maharashtra. USLL set up the Tarapur unit at a cost of Rs 32.50 million to produce Dow Corning high-tech lubricants and silicone sealants for the domestic market.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) yesterday decided to bring institutional investors _,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) yesterday decided to bring institutional investors _ foreign institutional investors, domestic financial institutions, mutual funds and banks _- within the ambit of margins.
 
 The regulator will work out  the quantum and modalities after a meeting with the institutions, to be convened within a week.
 
 Sebi also said that 50 per cent of all additional capital and margins furnished by brokers to an exchange would have to be in cash by March-end.
 
 In the meantime, it decided to slap a daily margin of five per cent on net outstanding positions of brokers till the end of the settlement, in 10 scrips identified as having huge outstandings, volumes and volatility.
 
 The regulator will also work out a new model for calculating volatility (and the subsequent additional volatility margin). It will measure short-term volatility in addition to the current system that measures volatility over a six-week period. 
 
 Brokers have also been directed to collect margins from all clients where the margins are in excess of Rs 1 lakh, a move never enforced strictly in the past. 
 
 The 10 scrips on which the five per cent margin will be applicable are: Infosys Technologies, Satyam Computers, Himachal Futuristic Communications, Silverline Technologies, NIIT, Zee Telefilms, Global Telesystems, Pentamedia Graphic, Digital Equipment and DSQ Software. This list will be modified from time to time. 
 
 The list comes in the wake of 11 scrips described by the National Stock Exchange last week as being highly risk-prone owing to high volatility and outstanding positions.
 
 Sebi chairman D R Mehta yesterday held discussions with representatives of the National, Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Uttar Pradesh stock exchanges. He said it was felt that a sizeable segment of the market (institutions) had till now been kept away from the ambit of the margin framework.
 
 ""A flat margin could be imposed. We want to discuss the issue with institutions before we announce the modalities. There could be an issue pertaining to FIIs not being able to bring in advance funds to pay margins. Issues like this, if found relevant, would be discussed and efforts made to iron out these difficulties. But in principle, we have decided to impose margins on institutions,"" Mehta said.
 
 This issue has been hanging fire for over three years. But recently, exchanges had told Sebi that it was high time these investors were brought within the ambit of margins as they were trading actively these days and thus posed as much of a threat to the markets as any other investor.
 
 ""It was considered that it would be appropriate to bring the institutional trades also under the purview of margins. The group recommended that, to begin with, a flat margin should be imposed. The modalities would be worked out after a meeting with the institutions within a week,"" said a Sebi statement. Stock exchanges have been asked to bring the cash component in additional capital and margins, up to 50 per cent by March-end in a phased manner. Currently, only 25 per cent of the margins and additional capital are payable in the form of cash. Recently, Sebi had said that top 25 brokers at every exchange would have to bring all additional capital and margins only in cash or FDRs. This decision would remain.

 ","The S V S Raghavan Committee on a new competition policy is in favour of an all-embracing law that will allow competition in almost all sectors, barring a few exemptions in national interest.
 
 The exemptions will be few and will be mentioned in a reserved list, especially in the case of defence and other `sovereign' functions. Ad-hoc exemptions are unlikely.
 
 The public distribution system is also likely to be exempted, given its implications and the dependence of a large section of the population. Protected sectors like small-scale industries may also be thrown open to competition. However, assistance may be ensured for such sectors by recommending cheap credit.
 
 Reservation for public sector enterprises may also not be possible, except in cases explicitly reserved. Price and purchase preferences could be challenged under the new policy. However, a transition period is likely to be provided to ensure continuity.
 
 In some cases, certain sectors/activities are reserved for government entities through international commitments. For instance, the monopoly of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd over international voice traffic is protected until 2004. The government has committed to the World Trade Organisation to review the monopoly in that year.
 
 Apart from a draft law being drawn up by the committee, there will be also be an extensive competition policy.  It will define various aspects of competition and lay down the principles and prerequisites of competition.
 
 The policy is expected to delineate a broad approach, while the law, being a statute, will have an enforceable nature. The legislation could then provide an umbrella framework for framing and notifying executive policies.

 The counter-guarantee for the 1,000 mw Bhadrawati project ended in January. The promoters were to have achieved financial closure by this time. 
 
 Officials said as the promoters failed to meet the conditions and did not ask for extension, the finance ministry referred the extension of the counter-guarantee to the law ministry.
 
 Both promoters and respective state governments have to fulfill certain conditions before the counter-guarantee comes into force. This includes finalising power purchase agreements and certification of the project cost by the state government.
 
 The Ispat group and the Hindujas were granted a six-month extension each last August to achieve financial closure. Both had signed their counter-guarantees in August 1998.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering a proposal to bring in a margining system through stock exchanges for issuance of shares through book-building.,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is considering a proposal to bring in a margining system through stock exchanges for issuance of shares through book-building. The move is aimed at eliminating the current concern over lack of any fixed upfront application money that an investor has to pay when investing through a bookbuilding issue. 
 
 Sebi has also decided not to end the current discretion that a book runner enjoys in allotting shares to non-retail investors. For retail investors, the allotment has to be done on a proportionate basis as per a recent Sebi diktat.
 
 As per the proposal submitted by Bombay Stock Exchange and discussed in detail by Sebi at a meeting with top merchant bankers on Monday, an investor would be margined at the time of making an application to an issue. 
 
 The issue would be marketed through the stock exchange route through broker's terminals and a margin would be fixed which would have to be paid by investors.
 
 ""Like in the case of secondary market, the stock exchange could insist on some margin at the time of application and then also stand guarantee for the application monies. An investor would apply to the broker and then depending on the allotment would either receive the shares or the funds. In the interim, a margin could be levied which would be kept with the stock exchange,"" said BSE president, Anand Rathi.
 
 Sebi chairman DR Mehta said that the issue of whether investors should be asked to pay a certain amount upfront and not misuse the current discretion in this regard, by making large applications, was discussed.
 
 ""There were some concerns expressed by the merchant bankers which have been considered. In the meantime, we have also received a model from the BSE. The issue is being discussed,"" said Mehta.
 
 Mehta added that there were no plans to end the discretion of merchant bankers in allotment to shares to non-retail investors.
 
 ""We have taken some decisions. Some of these may have to be taken to the board. A formal announcement on these measures would be made on Tuesday,"" said Mehta.

"The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has told the 1,050 mw Videocon power project to attain financial closure by April 30 .","The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has told the 1,050 mw Videocon power project to attain financial closure by April 30 . The project is coming up at Ponneri in Chengalput district near Chennai. 
 
 Confirming this, a TNEB official said, ""The power purchase agreement (PPA) had lapsed on February 1. The promoters had requested for an extension, but we have given them time till April 30. We hope the project comes through."" 
 
 However, chairman of Videocon International, the group flagship, V N Dhoot said, ""We have already attained financial closure. We will communicate our decision much before the deadline."" But the TNEB official retorted, ""we are unaware of the project attaining financial closure"". 
 
 TNEB was considering scrapping of  the PPA if the earlier deadline of February 1 was not met. But now, TNEB officials indicate that an extension beyond April 30 may be allowed in the interest of the project. 
 
 The project was originally slated to attain financial closure by April 30, 1999, but was stuck due to various problems. Later, the February 1, 2000 deadline could not be met due to certain disputes over the fuel supply agreement. Besides, lenders were keen on entering into certain agreements, superseding the PPA.
 
 The power project is being implemented as a joint venture between the Videocon group, ABB and National Power of the UK. Videocon is the largest shareholder with 38 per cent stake, while ABB and National Power are committed to bringing in 26 per cent and 36 per cent respectively.
 
 However, ABB is now reconsidering its decision to invest in the project and may eventually pull out although the Zurich-based parent is supposed to take a final decision in this regard.
 
 The ABB stand is that there are certain critical issues related to the returns the project offers to the investing companies that need to be resolved. Even if the company decides against taking an equity stake in the project, it will continue to be the engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the project.

State-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) is all set to acquire a Chennai-based software company.,"State-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) is all set to acquire a Chennai-based software company. According to sources, this is one of the software firms shortlisted by the telecom company with a turnover of between Rs 10 crore and 20 crore. 
 
 It also learnt that the telecom major will finalise the deal in another month's time. The software company will be acquired by MTNL to develop its in-house software needs.
 
 It is understood that MTNL would prefer the equity route for the acquisition. 
 
 The funds would be routed from the Rs 500 crore earmarked for overseas investments and acquisitions. 
 
 If acquired, the software firm would be directly under the control of the chairman and managing director and not be a part of  Millennium Telecom, the fully-owned subsidiary of MTNL for Internet related activities, which is  yet to be registered. 
 
 However, e-commerce activities and Net-related and value added services like ISDN and intelligent networks would be under Millennium Telecom. 
 
 This would be the first-ever acquisition by the telecommunications major which has ambitions of becoming an IT major, and of not being restricted to telecom. 
 
 Analysts also feel that MTNL is going in for the acquisition following the global trend of telecom companies buying out software units. 
 
 MTNL had, on November 19, 1999, amended the articles of association to allow it to diversify into other activities and provide services to various parts of the country and abroad. 
 
 The resolution was passed in the extraordinary general meeting of the company. This is to give the board powers to go ahead with programs without always getting back to the share holders for every issues. 
 
 MTNL has already announced that ""it has big plans to enter e-commerce"". MTNL will tie up with Rediff, Satyam and a slew of other portals to co-brand its portal www.bharatonline.com. 
 
 The company will initially forge alliances with Rediff-on-the-net and Satyam Infoway. The memoranda of understanding will be signed next week.
 
 It is also expected to tie up with more portals to attract more traffic to Bharatonline.com.

Insurance companies are usually found in the dock in consumer courts for deficiency in their services.,"Insurance companies are usually found in the dock in consumer courts for deficiency in their services. However, in recent times, they have put on the boots of the consumer and claimed compensation from others. The consumer courts have allowed their petitions.  But the Supreme Court has now stepped in and barred their entry into the consumer courts with complaints.
 
 In a definitive judgment earlier this month, the Supreme Court has ruled that an insurance company is not a `consumer' within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act and their complaints cannot be maintained (Oberoi Forwarding Agency vs New India Assurance). The definition of consumer under the Act has been the subject of intense discussion and one amendment, but this is one interpretation which is overdue.
 
 The insurance company in this case had insured goods for transport. The consignment was lost in transit. The consignor claimed the insured amount from the insurer. It was paid by the insurance company. The consignor then assigned his rights to the insurance company along with a power of attorney to enforce them. Armed with these documents, the insurance company moved the consumer forum for compensation from the forwarding agency. Three consumer courts, including the national commission, held in favour of the insurance company. On appeal, the Supreme Court laid down that an insurance company is not a consumer.
 
 If the judgments of the consumer courts had remained valid, it would have resulted in preposterous claims by insurers. After settling claims against them, they could have trooped into the consumer courts to make good their payments from the negligent party.  Though they can move the civil courts by applying the theory of abrogation and assignment, consumer forums were not set up to assuage the grievances of monopoly government undertakings, known for their own lethargy and negligence. The present judgment has stated in clear terms that they cannot approach the consumer courts.
 
 Section 2(d)(ii) makes it clear that it is only the person who had hired a service for consideration or any other person availing of the benefit of such service with his approval who could be regarded as a consumer. In this case, there was no question of the insurance company being a beneficiary of the service that the consignor had hired. Therefore, by no stretch of imagination can the insurance company be called a consumer.
 
 Assignment of the rights of the insured to the insurer itself is not quite in line with public interest. The insurance company may acquire the right to sue other parties after paying off the insured. The law does not permit transfer of the right to sue in favour of another. Therefore, what the company did in this case itself is legally doubtful.
 
 The Consumer Protection Act and the forums set up under it are intended to benefit individual consumers who buy goods or hire services. Recent judgments of the consumer courts have taken care to exclude business concerns and institutions from the courts except as respondents. Those who buy goods or services for commercial purposes are out of court, according to a 1993 amendment to the Act. For instance, a widow buying a sewing machine for her livelihood would be a consumer. But a shopowner who buys the same goods and employs tailors would be indulging in a commercial activity and therefore would not be a consumer entitled to move a forum if the machines are defective.
 
 If mammoth corporations, which have alternative remedies elsewhere, still enter the consumer forums in the garb of consumers, the situation points to another need _ that of keeping out the inventive lawyers who put such fancy dress on their corporate clients. The forums were originally intended to be informal places to help solve the problems of the lay persons fast and without much legal expenses. But they are now flooded with lawyers who carry tons of case law, trying to do to the consumer forums what they have done to the civil courts.

"Last Saturday, Reserve Bank of India governor, Bimal Jalan, was in Salboni (West Bengal) to inaugurate the main currency printing press of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Limited, which is RBI's wholly owned subsidiary.","Last Saturday, Reserve Bank of India governor, Bimal Jalan, was in Salboni (West Bengal) to inaugurate the main currency printing press of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Limited, which is RBI's wholly owned subsidiary. In about two months from now, the new press will achieve its full rated capacity, thereby fulfilling the country's entire demand for currency notes for the next 10 years. 
 
 The nation should heave a sigh of relief. Periodic shortages of currency notes of different denominations should come to an end.  Soiled and tattered notes that continue to remain in circulation should get replaced with new ones. A new policy to introduce clean notes is now being formulated in consultation with Arthur Andersen. Also, the dependence on imported currency notes will be over. And the RBI will enhance its ability and flexibility to introduce new designs and devices to counter the menace of fake notes.
 
 An obvious question arises: Given the advantages of creating indigenous capacity for printing currency notes, why did the nation have to wait for over 50 years to achieve self-sufficiency in this area? There are no easy answers. But if one looks back in search of an answer, what emerges is a story of vested interests nurtured by bureaucrats and politicians in power and their strange ways of decision-making. The inauguration of the Salboni  press is perhaps a good occasion to recall that story. 
 
 It was in the 1980s that the government of Indira Gandhi decided to set up two currency printing presses. These were to be set up by the government and like the other existing mints operating at that time, these two  presses too were to be owned and run by the finance ministry. Bureaucrats loved this. Politicians in power enjoyed this arrangement even more. 
 
 Setting up a currency note printing press and running it (there was a flourishing currency and coins division in the finance ministry at that time) meant an empire that did not end with just signing contracts, but extended to frequent visits abroad as well. Politicians agreed to such an arrangement because they felt they could distribute their quota of political patronage if the printing presses were set up and run by the government. Neither of the classes were bothered by the thought that ideally such a  printing press should be set up and run by the country's central bank, as is the practice in most developed countries. 
 
 Salboni in West Bengal and Mysore in Karnataka were identified as the sites where the presses were to be located. Pranab Mukherjee was the finance minister at that time and Janardhan Poojary was the minister of state for finance, who had by then become quite famous for his loan melas. There are no prizes for guessing why these two locations were preferred for setting up the presses. Salboni was that part of Bengal which Mr Mukherjee was then nurturing as his constituency and Mysore was close to Mr Poojary's heart, hailing as he did from Karnataka. 
 
 Mr Mukherjee and Mr Poojary were left out of the government headed by Rajiv Gandhi in 1985. But there was no change in the decision on setting up the printing presses. Nor was there any change in the location. But what did happen was quite interesting. By the time the decision on awarding the contracts became due, the controversy over payment of bribes for the purchase of Bofors guns had engulfed the nation.
 
 Bureaucrats in North Block had second thoughts. The contract for the presses had to be awarded to a foreign company and naturally involved a huge foreign exchange outgo. The fear was that a decision on awarding the contract at that time could kick off another controversy. So the government decided to entrust the responsibility of setting up the presses to the RBI. The implicit logic was to let  RBI handle the project, so that the government stayed out of the controversy. Also, it was believed that RBI would not allow either politicians or bureaucrats to interfere in its functioning and the project would get implemented without any controversy and delay. 
 
 RBI created a wholly owned subsidiary which was to set up the two printing presses. As it turned out, the total cost of the two presses after completion came to about Rs 1,650 crore, of which the foreign exchange component was as high as Rs 1,050 crore. Both the projects are now complete and no one hears of any controversy. Hopefully, the country's currency note shortage will now be a thing of the past.
 
 But what should come as a surprise is the manner in which bure-aucrats and politicians agreed to take certain right decisions for apparently wrong reasons. Currency note printing presses should not be set up and run by the government. But politicians and bure-aucrats wanted to perpetuate their control over this area for the wrong reasons. Even the decision on locating the two presses were taken on purely political considerations. 
 
 The Bofors controversy changed their minds. They were not convinced by the logic that such printing presses should ideally be set up and run by the country's central bank. They decided to divest themselves of this responsibility only when they feared that the government deciding on the award of contracts might create more  controversy at that time and land the government in a bigger problem. The decision was motivated by their desire to insulate the government against any fresh controversy. 
 
 If the country today has two new currency note printing presses, owned and run efficiently by RBI without any kickback scandal,  some credit for this should go to the Bofors controversy.

Matching in and out passenger traffic for an airline is not much of a problem since those who go out mostly return.,"Matching in and out passenger traffic for an airline is not much of a problem since those who go out mostly return. But cargo is a different ball game; trade does not always balance, least of all 
 
 merchandise  dispatched by air. And so, what kind of freight rates a carrier can offer depends on how 
 
 evenly balanced the two-way traffic is. 
 
 To Denis Connolly, general manager regions of British Airways (World Cargo), who was in Delhi last week, the prospects of all quantitative restrictions on imports going in a couple of years are exciting. This will raise import volumes and match exports, making prospects in India look ""most favourable"".
 
 For the Indian exporter of say flowers or high-value fashion garments, this will mean more attractive freight rates from carriers which can spread costs over two-way traffic. India is currently served by BA's services between the UK and Hong Kong and increasing frequencies are clearly on the cards.
 
 Since flights from Europe are lighter than the ones to Europe, ""it will become easier to raise frequency if we get a better flow of business to India,"" explains Connolly. 
 
 This apart, two developments have improved the prospects of the cargo business of BA, which contribu
 
 tes 8-10 per cent to its total  
 
 revenue. 
 
 In an attempt to improve yields (get rid of traffic that yields low or non-existent margins), BA has planned to reduce its passenger capacity next year by 2 per cent. So cargo will have a bigger share of the smaller capacity cake, so to speak. BA is also going in for a big induction of the Boeing 777, the latest long-haul aircraft which has smaller capacity than the jumbo and, what is good for Connolly, is ""very cargo efficient"". Connolly has to try hard to live down the reputation that cargo has of being the poor cousin in BA to which traditionally passenger traffic has come first by a long margin, unlike in some of its competitors which have paid more attention to cargo.

"A bigger thrust for cooperation between Indian and French middle-size businesses, an Indo-French water week, more scientific collaboration and a resolve to work jointly to develop information technology and food processing, were endorsed by the Indo-French Initiative Forum which met here on February 14 and 15.
 
 ","A bigger thrust for cooperation between Indian and French middle-size businesses, an Indo-French water week, more scientific collaboration and a resolve to work jointly to develop information technology and food processing, were endorsed by the Indo-French Initiative Forum which met here on February 14 and 15.
 
 Briefing the press, the French co-president of the Forum, Jean Francois Poncet, said that while large companies had the resources and could assess the size of the Indian market, middle-size businesses in France as well as India had little knowledge of each other.
 
 The forum's proposition was that  Indian business could benefit from technology and French business would get the chance to discover the potential of the large Indian market.
 
 The forum, an influential body in both India and France, also announced there would be more exchanges between India and France in the area of higher education (100 scholarships to be set up in both countries).
 
 Nasscom president Dewang Mehta did a presentation for the forum on possibilities for cooperation in information technology.
 
 There seemed to be some difference of opinion, however, on the civilian use of nuclear energy. While recognising India as a nuclear state,  France was noticeably gentler on India after the nuclear tests.
 
 Accordingly, Poncet said that French physics Nobel laureate, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, who is a member of the forum, was asked to contact ""someone in the Indian government"" to discuss possibilities of cooperation on the civilian uses of nuclear energy.
 
 Poncet  pointed out that there were ""problems"" in cooperation on civilian uses of nuclear energy, because of the dual- use nature of nuclear energy.
 
 However, the Indian co-president, Ramakrishna Hegde, quickly contradicted this and said that the matter was not discussed because it was a ""political"" issue and ""the forum does not discuss political issues"".

"The main issue that needs to be tackled in the Union Budget for 2000-2001 is the open-ended nature of subsidies.
 
 ","The main issue that needs to be tackled in the Union Budget for 2000-2001 is the open-ended nature of subsidies.
 
 According to sources in the Planning Commission, one of the main problems that must be addressed is the burgeoning subsidy bill. 
 
 It is argued that the total quantum of subsidies that can be offered under each head must be decided by the government and the prices adjusted and offered at this level.
 
 For instance, the government must finalise the total food subsidy amount and accordingly price the sugar, rice and wheat available through the public distribution system. This will make the subsidy close-ended.
 
 Sources also pointed out that it is not the quantum of cuts on the subsidy which is important but ensuring that it reaches the right target.
 
 They pointed out that the finance ministry needs to effect a correction with respect to the fertiliser subsidy where the excessive application of nitrogenous fertiliers is leading to large portions of Haryana and Punjab turning into wastelands.
 
 ""This, however, does not mean that fertiliser subsidy is bad per se"", explained an official.
 
 Senior government officials said that the main concern remains on the expenditure side and that taxes in general do not need to be tinkered with.
 
 It is argued that ""while a marginal rationalisation of taxes is needed, it need not be done this year since every year when tax rates are changed there is a cost to this. It is better for the finance minister to concentrate on tax administration rather than the rates this year"". 
 
 If tax rates are stable, then the focus can be on administration of taxes. It is argued that low revenues are due to poor tax administration.
 
 It was also argued that while it is not necessary to cut the peak customs rate, the surcharge needs to be removed.
 
 On the excise side, sources said that the Planning Commission had pointed out to the finance ministry that huge misuse of modvat has to be plugged. Sources said that the total modvat offset had shot up from 22 per cent to 42 per cent of gross excise in three years. 
 
 ""There is no explanation for this. If this misuse is plugged and the offset is around 25-26 per cent of gross excise, excise collections will zoom"", said sources.

 ","The Union minister for urban development, Jagmohan, has promised to look into the problem of heavy default by Central government agencies to civic bodies in West Bengal.
 
 The Indian Railways alone owes Howrah Municipal Corporation Rs 300 crore in service tax. Dues to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are nearly Rs 50 crore.
 
 The West Bengal urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya told newsmen here yesterday that Jagmohan was sympathetic to the demand for necessary constitutional amendment empowering civic bodies to tax Central government properties. 
 
 Jagmohan is in Calcutta in 
 
 connection with the two-day 
 
 regional meet on devolution of functional and financial powers to urban local bodies.
 
 The CMC mayor Prasanta Chatterjee said the necessary amendment will enable the civic bodies to not only tax Central properties, but also use the sub-soil for various service connections. Changed legal provisions will also empower the CMC to charge private agencies for use of the sub-soil. Chatterjee was referring 
 
 to the CESC-owned underground power cables and also the optical fibre cables network laid by the company to carry television programmes.
 
 Jagmohan regretted that the financial and management needs of Indian cities have been underplayed. Although 90 per cent of government revenues and 60 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) came from the urban areas, in return, they received only 0.6 per cent of the GDP at the municipal level.
 
 Jagmohan said, ""It is obvious that our municipalities have not benefited from the magnitude of activities that take place within their jurisdiction and are thus prejudicial to the Indian economy. Against this position in India, the ratio of local expenditure to total expenditure was 22 per cent in 18 industrialised nations, 20 per cent for four east European countries and nine per cent for 16 developing countries.""
 
 Percentage of plan allocation for urban development schemes has declined from 8 per cent of the total Plan outlay in 1951 to 2.6 per cent now. ""In the arena of urban infrastructure alone, at least Rs 20,000 crore per annum would be required over the next 10 years, over and above the plan resources, to make good the present deficiencies,"" he said.

 ","The Nationalist Congress Party yesterday fully supported its leader P A Sangma's decision to join the Constitution Review Commission despite the party's decision-making body having opposed the review.
 
 NCP president Sharad Pawar yesterday said Sangma had joined the commission in his personal capacity and not as a member of the party. 
 
 Pawar had clearly indicated on Monday itself that the party would support Sangma. Admitting that he and Sangma could not discuss the proposal before Sangma accepted the offer, Pawar had indicated that he would stand by Sangma's decision.
 
 Pawar said the party had initially opposed the review since it had feared that the government might push through its hidden agenda through the exercise. 
 
 It was also apprehensive that the government might meddle with the basic features of the Constitution and the Parliamentary form of democracy.
 
 These fears no longer exist with the appointment of Justice 
 
 M N Venkatachalaiah as the chairman of the panel and also by 
 
 the announcement of the 
 
 broad terms of reference by the government.  
 
 The terms of reference make it clear that the review will not disturb the basic features of the Constitution and that it will be conducted within the broad parameters of the Parliamentary form of democracy, Pawar said.
 
 With the main worries of the NCP addressed, the party is now in favour of the exercise. Moreover, Sangma's inclusion would ensure that the interests of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and the minorities are represented, Pawar said. 
 
 Pawar was talking to the Press at his residence yesterday, following media reports that sharp differences had cropped up between him and Sangma over the party's attitude to the commission.

"On December 16, a drama of a different kind was unfolding at Kala Mandir, the well-known auditorium in upmarket Shakespeare Sarani in south Calcutta.","On December 16, a drama of a different kind was unfolding at Kala Mandir, the well-known auditorium in upmarket Shakespeare Sarani in south Calcutta. The top management of ANZ Grindlays Bank, led by its country head Anuroop `Tony' Singh, was explaining the new vision for the bank to its employees from the city and the outskirts. 
 
 The task wasn't simple: considerable confusion and misconception surrounded the ANZ gameplan and many of the employees were prone to viewing Singh with a fair degree of suspicion. After all, he had only recently joined ANZ from Bank of America, and had, quite suddenly, got into overdrive, meeting employees at similar dos, called ""townhall meetings"" , in New Delhi and other places. What was Singh up to?
 
 Quite a lot, in fact. Since taking charge around the middle of last year, Singh, an aggressive banker who is also ANZ's regional head of personal financial services for south and west Asia, has been working on convincing the ANZ headquarters in Australia of the pressing need to restructure ANZ India entirely. To transform an apparently stodgy foreign bank operating in India to one which innovates and moves at a frenetic pace to deliver to the customer what competitors would think of delivering tomorrow. Singh was successful. And hence, began putting in place a detailed growth gameplan for the bank which sought to transform it completely. 
 
 Titled ""Fast Forward to Win"", the new ANZ growth recipe covers a huge array of areas _- business portfolios, technology and subsidiaries. The Indian management can spend Rs 150 crore over three years on this recast.
 
 Says Singh, ""Contrary to perception, ours is clearly an expansionist policy. We will grow the business and transform the bank to keep pace with the changes. The plan is to grow the business three times over the next five years. The plan will also be reviewed every year and minor course corrections made if necessary.""
 
 According to the plan, the investment areas would be in technology, distribution, new products, people and the brand. 
 
 With personal financial services (PFS) also his forte, Singh has  set a target of getting the share of PFS in ANZ's India portfolio to rise substantially to 50 per cent, from the present 20 per cent now, in five years' time. By then, corporate financial services (CFS) will have an equal share of the cake. Not that corporate finance will decline, but just that with the overall business set to rise, the rate of growth of PFS is slated to be higher.
 
 ""We want to leverage our huge base of 500,000 customers and over 1000 corporates and emerge as a full service bank in every respect,"" explains Singh. The growth plan also aims at leveraging the fact that ANZ, with 40 branches, has the largest network among foreign branches in India now, and four new branch licences have already been acquired by the bank. ""There is a corporate commitment to invest in the largest business outside of Australasia,"" he says.
 
 Clearly, technology is also at the very core of the bank's plan to move forward. A spanking new technology platform, the Commercial Banking System (CBS), is being put in place which will lend a cutting edge to the bank's technology. The plan is also to transfer the success of its e-commerce leadership in Australia to its Indian business, as ANZ is certain that technology will determine the final stakes in Indian banking like never before.
 
 ANZ  plans to raise subordinate debt and liquidate surplus residential properties and has already identified 10 to 15 such properties for liquidation. The growth plans have also clearly been broken down to fit into ANZ's CFS and PFS priorities.
 
 On CFS, the aim is to achieve market leadership in corporate and investment banking. Besides, a slew of new products are being lined up, including Web-enabled cash management solutions and channel financing for dealers. The plan also takes into account offering comprehensive risk management for corporates through currency options and interest rate derivatives.
 
 The CFS offensive will also entail increasing ANZ's market dominance in advisory businesses including project finance, and mergers and acquisitions by investing in specific industries like oil and gas, information technology and the media. The unique selling proposition of the bank in the CFS area will be focused on high quality client services through dedicated customer service teams led by senior bankers.
 
 On the PFS side, the offensive entails technology and Web-enabled services like Internet banking, enhanced branch access options, a greater number of branches and 365-day banking. Investments in non-branch channels are also being made, as in ATMs, doorstep banking, telephone banking and the like, to get the bank to the customer. Among new products are debit cards, global use credit cards, and demat OD.
 
 ANZ has already obtained Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) approval for launching a debt fund through a separate asset management company. Also, the personal finance thrust will be made through subsidiary Esanda, where the ANZ stake of 51 per cent will be hiked to 75 per cent.
 
 But ANZ knows that to put all this in place, a complete change in the attitude of the ANZ employees is required. Hence, Singh's townhall meetings, where he lays online the bank's agenda for the future and takes questions from employees. ""The employees will need to change their approach, move from the rear to the front-room in some cases. There will be dramatic changes and they will be required to respond,"" Singh points out.
 
 But the employees are not as bullish as he is. Says Dilip Dutta, general secretary, All-India Grindlays Bank Employees Federation:""We are not so sure it is an expansionist policy. The employees are very concerned about the security of their jobs in the changed environment, with a number of functions increasingly getting outsourced.""
 
 Dutta, whose union is affiliated to the Bank Employees' Federation of India (Befi) in West Bengal, says the employees do not have problems in accepting outsourcing where it has been provided for in the bank's agreements with employees, but the trend, he claims, is to get other non-agreement functions outsourced as well. A section of employees are also apprehensive about the impact of the CBS platform, once it is fully implemented. Besides, Dutta's union is also against the seven-day banking proposal, which he says goes against the West Bengal shops and establishment laws.
 
 While Singh says that a Resource Management Centre (RMC) set up by the bank aims to assess employee skills and function as a kind of inhouse employment agency to redeploy people within departments, some employees feel the centre may be a first step towards identifying surplus employees.
 
 In fact, the townhall meetings are also aimed at allaying such fears, says Singh, but even after attending the meeting, some employees and the union leadership view the plans with suspicion.
 
 Singh is, however, clear that the spirit of open communication within ANZ Grindlays, which has now been articulated through the townhall meetings, will continue. The townhall meetings will now be held every six months, there will be external and internal customer satisfaction surveys and the bank will also encourage regular ""skip level"" meetings, where the boss of one department is not present when his team interacts with the next higher level.
 
 ""We are also putting together an intranet website for raising queries, disseminating information and addressing staff concerns,"" Singh says, adding that these initiatives are aimed at making the ANZ employee raise issues they want to and put in suggestions.
 
 Singh is marketing his growth plan to employees by presenting it as a superior value proposition for them. How?
 
 Tangible rewards will come in by way of pay for performance and recognition for contribution. There will be growth opportunities in the new regime by way of skill-building programmes and well-defined career progression. A greater sense of belonging will be instilled by better information access and frequent communication. Last, but not the least, a better work environment will come about by way of improved workplace conditions and enhanced technology, Singh says.
 
 While the Kala Mandir meeting went off, by and large without a hitch, the challenge for Singh will now be to move the plan forward without any major resistance from the employees. A hardboiled banker, he will have to tread the middle path between meeting the needs of the fast-changing banking environment and a section of employees who fear their jobs may be the first casualties of this change.

"Just as some rebel leaders were planning to put pressure on Congress president Sonia Gandhi to step down, the party leadership yesterday announced the schedule for organisational elections to be held through secret ballot. 
 
 ","Just as some rebel leaders were planning to put pressure on Congress president Sonia Gandhi to step down, the party leadership yesterday announced the schedule for organisational elections to be held through secret ballot. 
 
 This is the first time that the party will hold elections through secret ballot for all levels. 
 
 The rebels will now find it difficult to gather support as the party elections will provide a forum to members to choose their leader. 
 
 Elections will be held at all levels, from the block to the central level. Congress representatives will be issued ballot papers for electing their leaders for the block Congress committees, district, pradesh and all India Congress committees. Polling booths will be set up and only unit level elections will be held by the raising of hands as enshrined in the party constitution.
 
 So far, only the Congress Working Committee members and the party president used to be elected through secret ballot.
 
 ""Secret ballot will reassure party members that organisational elections are free and fair. It will help those who have 
 
 truly worked in membership drive,"" senior Congress leader and chairman of the party's Central Election Authority Ramniwas Mirdha said, while announcing a detailed schedule for the poll. 
 
 He said polling would also check bogus membership as each representative would have to come to the polling booth personally.
 
 ""We will not accept even a unanimous resolution (electing someone or a panel). There has to be an election. Only when there is not more than one candidate, would the candidate be declared as elected,"" Mirdha said.
 
 Polling for the party president's post, if necessary, will take place on June 30. In case only one candidate contests, an announcement will be made on June 15, the last date for filing nominations. Elections for all other levels will be held before that.
 
 The announcement of 
 
 the poll schedule just a couple 
 
 of weeks before the results 
 
 of the Assembly elections are declared, is being seen as a move to stem any rebellion against Sonia's leadership.
 
 Our Political Bureau
 
 NEW DELHI
 
 
 
 The Congress is drawing up a plan for mass action in Delhi to coincide with the Budget session of Parliament. Congress leaders said the demonstration would draw party workers from nearby states.
 
 The details of the action 
 
 plan and the date will be decided 
 
 by the Congress Working Committee once campaigning 
 
 for the Assembly elections in the four states is over. Most of the senior party functionaries are campaigning in Bihar, Haryana, and Orissa where polling is to be held soon.
 
 With the party's unflinching support to economic reforms, the Congress could not join other opposition parties that had been agitating on economic issues. 
 
 However, controversies relating to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) and its offshoot like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) have given the Congress enough issues to take to the streets.
 
 Congress president Sonia Gandhi has been signalling her party functionaries to take to the streets, but has not achieved much success, so far. 
 
 The Sankalp Yatra could not succeed because most of the middle-level functionaries were not sufficiently enthused. Soina herself drew poor crowds in Ahmedabad where the yatra culminated. She followed this up with courting arrest in Delhi which was once again not taken up by the state leaders. 
 
 Party functionaries are, therefore, keeping their fingers crossed as far as the crowd response to the Congress rally is concerned. The rally is likely to take place in the first week of March.
 
 The party is even likely to have floor coordination with other secular opposition parties to take on the BJP and the government on the Sangh Parivar's sudden spurt in activities. 
 
 In fact, party leaders feel issues are adding up on a daily basis. First, it was the decision of the Gujrat government to allow its employees to take part in RSS activities. This was followed up by a similar order in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal.
 
 Then came the controversy over the film Water when Sangh activists prevented film-maker Deepa Mehta from shooting the film despite the fact that she had obtained permission from the Central and the UP governments. 
 
 Even as the furore over the two controversies was still raging, ABVP activists in Kanpur on Monday blackened the faces of couples celebrating Valentine's Day. 
 
 Perhaps as a buildup to its agitation programme, the party is attacking the Sangh Parivar's saffron agenda at its daily briefings.

 With signs of recovery in south-east Asian economies, the pressure on domestic prices due to cheap imports is likely to be less. The cost-control exercise, being undertaken with the help of Andersen Consulting, is likely to contribute to overall cost savings.

 Operating expenses, as a percentage of turnover, came down by 6.5 per cent. The cost of financing per tonne of production was reduced by 5 per cent. Its plant utilisation capacity went up to 66 per cent from 57 per cent in the previous year.
 
 The directors have recommended a net dividend of 10 per cent. PCBL board has decided to appoint Sudhir Sahgal as the managing director of the company for a period of five years with effect from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2004.

 ","Toyota-Kirloskar Motor Ltd is likely to increase the price of the base model of Qualis, its newly-launched multi-purpose vehicle, soon.
 
 Toyota-Kirloskar managing director Sachio Yamazaki told Business Standard that once the customers become familiar with the Toyota brand name, the company will increase the price of its base model which is priced around Rs 4.5 lakh. ""We wanted our customers to try a Toyota at an attractive price,"" Yamazaki said. He said the `touch & try' campaign had been able to woo a large number of customers. Yamazaki said the marketing strategy was backed by a strong product, was economically priced, safe and comfortable.
 
 He said the Indian customers look for a utility product which was competitively priced. ""We have been able to provide them such a product through Qualis,"" Yamazaki said. He said Qualis was slotted as a passenger vehicle and not as a commercial vehicle.
 
 Yamazaki said the existing plant will be further expanded with an investment of around Rs 60 crore. He said the dealer network too would be expanded to around 23 by next year. He said because of the increase in bookings, the vehicles could no longer be made available `off-the-shelf'. ""We have already delivered around 1,000 so far and to increase production, we are doubling the shift,"" he said.
 
 Yamazaki said nearly 60 per cent of those who had bought Qualis opted for the finance scheme. Toyota-Kirloskar has floated a financing arm called Toyota Financial Services in association with Citibank for retail financing for Qualis. Worldwide, Toyota already has a tie-up with Citibank for retail financing. Toyota will also have regional tie-ups with ICICI, Countrywide and Kotak Mahindra among others for retail financing. During the first year, the company had targetted at a production of 20,000 MPVs, by the second year, around 30,000 MPVs and by the third year, around 40,000.
 
 As per the investment pattern worked out by Toyota Kirloskar Motor Company, during the first phase, its investment in the vehicle project would be around $170 million, in the second phase, between $400 million-$700 million and for each subsequent model around $ 400 million.
 
 This would be on a capital of Rs 6,000 crore. It expects to recover all its costs from its investment in the multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) by the sixth year of its operations. The target for localisation has been set at 55 per cent in the first year which would be more than DGFT guideline of around 50 per cent to be achieved in three years.  The company expects to achieve localisation of 70 per cent within the stipulated time frame of five years.

 ","Dunlop India president M D Shukla has informed the representatives of the CITU union that the management hoped to start commercial production at the Sahaganj unit in mid-April.
 
 Shukla said at least one month was needed to establish the proper infrastructure required for commercial production at the unit which is closed for the past two years.
 
 However, the CITU leaders differ from the Shukla's view on time requirement for setting up infrastructure as the management had reportedly assured them to begin production within a day after re-opening of the factory, slated on March 11.
 
 A representative of the Citu-led Dunlop Workers' Union said, "" The management maintains the tradition of denying its assurance. Earlier, it said that a 24-hour time is enough to start production. ""
 
 It can be recalled that the Dunlop India management had 
 
 backed out from its decision to re-open the Sahaganj factory on March 7 when the Citu-led union did not put its signature on the minutes of a January 6 bipartite meeting.
 
 However, it had agreed on Friday to re-open the factory, 
 
 following the mediation of the West Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu.
 
 In a meeting with the CITU-affiliated union, Shukla said today that the tyre company will concentrate on 100 per cent industrial items namely OTR (over the roads) and aero products. The company has already bagged an export order of 4,000 tyres from Bangladesh, he said.
 
 Shukla also said the company was expecting an order for steel cord belting from Neivelling Lignite Corporation which was canceled for the delay in re-opening the unit. It will take 10 weeks to import the required inputs for 
 
 producing steel belting from a German firm. 
 
 He said the company has also ordered critical members including engineers and marketing executives to return to Calcutta immediately.
